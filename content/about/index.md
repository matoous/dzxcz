Hi, I'm Matouš!

I work as a software engineer at [SumUp](https://sumup.com/) and do a lot of sports.
I am currently training for my first [Ironman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon)
and an [Ultramarathon](https://www.aranbyutmb.com/en/). I run and cycle a lot but I'm neglecting the swimming.
I do plenty of other sports too, like backcountry skiing, climbing, and anything else that I find enjoyable.

The rest of my free time is spent on coding, [reading](/books), cooking, and other stuff.
In 2019 I also started this blog to force myself into writing more and to have a place where I could share my
thoughts and knowledge. Please take this whole site with grain of salt as my english is far from perfect,
and I feel like creating a coherent piece of writing is still impossible task for me
([I am working on it though]({{< ref "/books/sense_of_style" >}})).

Other than that, I enjoy quantifying my life. I keep track of my finances (using [ledger]({{< ref "/posts/ledger" >}})),
activites (on [strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/36515485), newly also on [this blog]({{< ref "/stats" >}})),
and other metrics that I don't currently publish here. I do this because I enjoy statistics and data even though
I am mediocre at best at both. By sharing the stats publicly on this blog I hold myself more accountable.

## Philosophy

I am pragmatic [optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism), [ISTJ-A (Logistician)](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality)
personality type according to [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator).
_ISTJ_ can be split into 4 individual traits, [Introverted](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted),
[Observant](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant), [Thinking](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling),
and [Judging](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting). The `-A` suffix at the end
stands for [Assertive](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/assertive-logistician-istj-a-vs-turbulent-logistician-istj-t).
I highly recommend trying the 16 personalities test youtself, while not tentative I find the insights helpful
in learning more about yourself.

## Words to live by

> I am most likely destined for average life, which is completely fine.
  If you zoom out further and it becomes pretty hard to view this tiny spec of time we've given
  and all it's trappings as anything more than ridiculous. You could become the most famous person in all of human history,
  build empires, construct massive monuments to your achievement, etch your damn face into the earth with a laser in space...
  and you'd still have just as much importance, in the scale of time and space, as every human that ever lived. Zero.[^average]
