Hi, I'm Matouš!

I work as a software engineer at [SumUp](https://sumup.com/) and do a lot of sports.
The rest of my free time is spent on coding, friends, [reading](/books), cooking, and other stuff.
This blog was started in 2019 to force myself into writing more and to have a place where I could share my
thoughts and knowledge. Please take this whole site with grain of salt as my english is far from perfect,
and I feel like creating a coherent piece of writing is still impossible task for me
([I am working on it though]({{< ref "/books/sense_of_style" >}})).

## Philosophy

I am pragmatic [optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism), [ISTJ-A (Logistician)](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/b62d4560c6e86)
personality type according to [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator).

To greater or lesser extend I identify with following philosophies:

- [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)

  > The core teachings of Stoicism focus on the development of self-control and resilience in the face of life's
  > difficulties, and emphasize the importance of living in accordance with reason. Stoics believe that the key to a happy
  > and fulfilling life is to focus on what is within our control, and to cultivate inner peace by accepting the things that
  > are outside our control. They also believe in living a virtuous life, and see wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance
  > as the four cardinal virtues.

## Career

{{<details "**Senior Software Engineer @ [SumUp](https://sumup.com/)**, _6/2021_ - _now_">}}
Working in the Platform Tribe - Identity Squad along with a 10 incredible teammates.
The IAM (Identity & Access Management) team had its inception 2 months before I joined SumUp and became
fully staffed only in the summer of 2022 after a series of incidents. In the 2 years so far
we have build company-wide SSO (Single Sign-On) based on [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) and [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).
Once the platform was stablized we worked (and still) do on MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), API Gateways, request signing,
and most importantly fixing and cleaning a lot of legacy code.

Apart from the IAM related responsibilities I spend some time on our public APIs, traffic, and RFCs.

Developing core infrastructure and services with speed and maintainability as the primary goal.
Growing my experience and knowledge thanks to awesome team and mentorship from other
skilled people in the company. Slowly taking more responsibility and bigger tasks such
as initiating gRPC adoption across the company, helping build internal golang packages
for cross-team usage, and developing multiple internal core APIs with high availability
and stability demand.

# Etc.

I keep most of the other cool stuff in my [wiki](https://wiki.dzx.cz). Here's distilled content that I thing might be of interest to anyone that stumbled upon this page.

## Articles

I am big fan of long format investigative writing. If the author spends the time researching the topic and is able to assimilate accumulated knowledge
into a coherent piece writing the topic stops being relevant. This list is longer than I originally intended but I read a lot and there's just simply a lot of great
articles worth mentioning:

## Quotes

> I am most likely destined for average life, which is completely fine.
  If you zoom out further and it becomes pretty hard to view this tiny spec of time we've given
  and all its trappings as anything more than ridiculous. You could become the most famous person in all of human history,
  build empires, construct massive monuments to your achievement, etch your damn face into the earth with a laser in space...
  and you'd still have just as much importance, in the scale of time and space, as every human that ever lived. Zero.[^average]
