Hi, I'm **Matou≈°**!

I work as a golang backend engineer at [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com) and study cybersecurity
at [CTU](https://www.cvut.cz/en/) in Prague. Throughout my career I have fulfilled various programming
and engineering roles. Currently, I am passionate about the clean, effective, and concise golang code
that saved our company a lot of headaches and money.

I enjoy plenty of things including but not limited to [reading](/books), cooking, 
[sports](https://www.strava.com/athletes/36515485), and working.
In 2019 I also started this blog to force myself into writing more and to have a place where I could share my
thoughts and knowledge. Please take this whole site with grain of salt as my english is far from perfect,
and I feel like creating a coherent piece of writing is still impossible task for me
([I am working on it though]({{< ref "/books/sense_of_style" >}})).
