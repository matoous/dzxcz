Hi, I'm Matouš!

I work as a software engineer at [SumUp](https://sumup.com/) and do a lot of sports.
I am currently training for my first [Ironman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon)
and an [Ultramarathon](https://www.aranbyutmb.com/en/). I run and cycle a lot but I'm neglecting the swimming.
I do plenty of other sports too, like backcountry skiing, climbing, and anything else that I find enjoyable.

The rest of my free time is spent on coding, [reading](/books), cooking, and other stuff.
In 2019 I also started this blog to force myself into writing more and to have a place where I could share my
thoughts and knowledge. Please take this whole site with grain of salt as my english is far from perfect,
and I feel like creating a coherent piece of writing is still impossible task for me
([I am working on it though]({{< ref "/books/sense_of_style" >}})).

## Philosophy

I am pragmatic [optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism), [ISTJ-A (Logistician)](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/b62d4560c6e86)
personality type according to [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator).
_ISTJ_ can be split into 4 individual traits, [Introverted](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted),
[Observant](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant), [Thinking](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling),
and [Judging](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting). The `-A` suffix at the end
stands for [Assertive](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/assertive-logistician-istj-a-vs-turbulent-logistician-istj-t).
I highly recommend trying the 16 personalities test youtself, while not tentative I find the insights helpful
in learning more about yourself.

To greater or lesser extend I identify with following philosophies:

- [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)

  > The core teachings of Stoicism focus on the development of self-control and resilience in the face of life's
  > difficulties, and emphasize the importance of living in accordance with reason. Stoics believe that the key to a happy
  > and fulfilling life is to focus on what is within our control, and to cultivate inner peace by accepting the things that
  > are outside our control. They also believe in living a virtuous life, and see wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance
  > as the four cardinal virtues.

- [Hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism), specifically [Epicurean Hedonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism#Epicureanism)

  > Hedonism refers to a family of theories, all of which have in common that pleasure plays a central role in them.
  > Psychological or motivational hedonism claims that human behavior is determined by desires to increase pleasure and to
  > decrease pain.

  _Hedonism_ is a viewpoint that pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain is the highest good and the proper aim of
  human life. This can involve the enjoyment of physical sensations, emotional fulfillment, and the attainment of desired
  experiences and material goods.  _Epicurean Hedonism_ further extends this belive to emphasize the importance of
  balancing pleasure with avoiding pain and discomfort, and views the attainment of long-term happiness as the ultimate
  goal (whereas _Cyrenaic Hedonism_ prioritizes immediate pleasure regardless of the long-term consequences or impact on
  well-being).

  For me this roughly translates into pursuit of well being, happiness (of me and people around me), and priorisation of
  lasting experiences over material goods. _Hedonism_ is individualistic believe. Although, if one finds joy in well-being
  of others as well as theirs, it can overlap with [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) that I
  find relatable as well.

## Words to live by

> I am most likely destined for average life, which is completely fine.
  If you zoom out further and it becomes pretty hard to view this tiny spec of time we've given
  and all it's trappings as anything more than ridiculous. You could become the most famous person in all of human history,
  build empires, construct massive monuments to your achievement, etch your damn face into the earth with a laser in space...
  and you'd still have just as much importance, in the scale of time and space, as every human that ever lived. Zero.[^average]
