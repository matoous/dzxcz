Hi, I'm Matouš!

I work as a software engineer at [SumUp](https://sumup.com/) and do a lot of sports.
The rest of my free time is spent on coding, friends, [reading](/books), cooking, and other stuff.
This blog was started in 2019 to force myself into writing more and to have a place where I could share my
thoughts and knowledge. Please take this whole site with grain of salt as my english is far from perfect,
and I feel like creating a coherent piece of writing is still impossible task for me
([I am working on it though]({{< ref "/books/sense_of_style" >}})).

## Career

{{<details "**Senior Software Engineer @ [SumUp](https://sumup.com/)**, _6/2021_ - _now_" open>}}

Working in the Platform Tribe - Identity Squad along with a 10 incredible teammates. The IAM (Identity & Access Management) team had its inception 2 months before I joined SumUp and we scale from 3 people drowning in incidents and work to 10 people in 2022 drowning only in work.

In the 3 years so far I have contributed to building a company-wide SSO (Single Sign-On) based on [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) and [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/), authored a generic MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) API that support recovery codes, TOTPs, SMS OTPs, webauthn credentials, and bootstrapped ReBAC-based access control system from RFC, to proof-of-concept, load testing, to adoption and general availability. Apart from the IAM related responsibilities I spend time on our public APIs, running an RFC forum, and Golang and Rust guild.

{{<details "**Golang Backend Developer @ [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/)**, _2/2019 - 5/2021_" open>}}

At Kiwi our team's responsibility was developing core infrastructure and services with speed and maintainability as the primary goal. Our services served thousands of requests per second and served as the base for the transportation search engine. During my time at Kiwi I grew my experience and knowledge thanks to awesome team and mentorship from other skilled people in the company.

My contributions specifically included initiating gRPC adoption across the company, helping build internal golang packages
for cross-team usage, and developing multiple internal core APIs supporting search search functionality serving 100M request every day.

## Philosophy

I am pragmatic [optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism), [ISTJ-A (Logistician)](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/b62d4560c6e86)
personality type according to [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator).

To greater or lesser extend I identify with following philosophies:

- [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)
  > The core teachings of Stoicism focus on the development of self-control and resilience in the face of life's difficulties, and emphasize the importance of living in accordance with reason. Stoics believe that the key to a happy and fulfilling life is to focus on what is within our control, and to cultivate inner peace by accepting the things that are outside our control. They also believe in living a virtuous life, and see wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance as the four cardinal virtues.
