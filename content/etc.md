## Articles

I am big fan of long format investigative writing. If the author spends the time researching the topic and is able to assimilate accumulated knowledge
into a coherent piece writing the topic stops being relevant. This list is longer than I originally intended but I read a lot and there's just simply a lot of great
articles worth mentioning:
