This weekend I have been updating and rewritting my CV, in [Typst](https://typst.app/). The official description of Typst is:

> A new markup-based typesetting system that is powerful and easy to learn.

which is true and maybe even an understatement. Typst is _easy_ to learn, so much so that after understanding a few basic principles, one can guess how the rest works (exaggering here, but the language is indeed neatly designed and structured). It's a [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) for human beings. Typst support all the important things out of the box; tables, bibliography, figures, you name it. Furthermore, there's the [Typst Universe](https://typst.app/universe/search?kind=packages) with evergrowing number of packages, to name a few, there's a [IEEE-style paper template](https://typst.app/universe/package/charged-ieee), [codly](https://typst.app/universe/package/codly) for code snippets, [drafting](https://typst.app/universe/package/drafting) for comments and margin notes and much more, all easily searchable.

I wish Typst existing back during my university years. LaTeX was a love-hate relationship, especially when it comes to installing packages and running everything locally.
