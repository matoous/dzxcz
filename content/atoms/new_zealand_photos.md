Peter Jackson's pick of New Zealand as the filming location of the original trilogy of Lord of the Rings was a rightful pick even if it wasn't his homeland. New Zealand's nature is majestic in every aspect and the only thing I was missings was Howard Shore's _The Ride of the Rohirrim_ queuing in whenever I entered a coffee shop.
