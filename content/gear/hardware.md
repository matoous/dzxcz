- [Apple MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/)
- [iPhone 13 mini](https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/). I was split on whether to buy 13 or 13 mini when my trusty iPhone 7 stopped working.
After some back and forth the decision was made to opt for the smaller model. It's a phone and does the things that all other phones do.
It stays charged throughout the day (the previous one didn't), takes great pictures (the limit is currently my artistic sense, not the phone),
can navigate me wherever I need.
- [AirPods 3rd generation](https://www.apple.com/airpods-3rd-generation/). For a long time I refrained from buying expensive-_ish_ wireless headphones. I loved the basic Apple airpods that used to be inlcuded in the box.
When I broke the last ones that I got with my [iphone 7]() I switched to cheap [Seinheisser XXX](), the reasonale being that I will eventually leave them in
a pocket of my running shorts and wash them. Those were only for sports and at work I used their bigger sibling [](). Eventually, when iPods 3 came out,
I decided to give them a shot to see how they compare to their wired predecessors that I held so dear and it was a great decision.
I can't be bothered by wires again, ever. The sounds quality is stellar compared to what I had before and the Airpods already survived a few beatings
(dropped them second week after purchase on a bike at 40 km/h) which is another big plus. For me they strike nice balance between simplicity,
sound quality, and price and I most likely won't be migrating to anything else anytime soon.
