I am slowly iterating towards have a few brands that have consistently good products that I like. In general I aim for brands with good reputation[^patagonia][^asket] even if that means paying premium. My woredrobe consistent mostly of plain, logo-less clothing

## Tshirts

All plain in tame colors, from [Asket](https://www.asket.com/us), [Zagh](https://myzagh.cz/en) (a Czech brand), [Pangaia](https://eu.pangaia.com/), and ocassionally [Zara](https://www.zara.com/). Recently I am a fan of the oversized and skater fit.

## Pants

All my pants at the moment are from [Lululemon](https://shop.lululemon.com/) and specifically two of their models, the _ABC Slim-Fit Pant_ and _Commission Slim-Fit Pant_. I wear size 32" and they are the best fit I have found so far. Event he slim-fit cut fits well for figures with larger quads and don't restrict the movement. I have different colors on rotation and for the hot some weather wear the WovenAir version with perforated fabric.
