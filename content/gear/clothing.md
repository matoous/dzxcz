## Pants

All my pants at the moment are from [Lululemon](https://shop.lululemon.com/) and specifically two of their models, the _ABC Slim-Fit Pant_ and _Commission Slim-Fit Pant_. I wear size 32" and they are the best fit I have found so far. Event he slim-fit cut fits well for figures with larger quads and don't restrict the movement. I have different colors on rotation and for the hot some weather wear the WovenAir version with perforated fabric.
