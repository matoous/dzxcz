## The Bag

Currently I use [Thule Aion 40l](https://www.thule.com/luggage/carry-on-luggage/thule-aion-travel-backpack-40l-_-3204724)
as my every day carry. It's big, sturdy, ideal when you want to bring clothes and shoes to go for a run after work and
still buy the groceries on your way home. 40l initially seemed like an excesive volume for an every-day
back pack but now I would hardly go for anything smaller.

Previously I used [The Backpack Pro](https://eu.dbjourney.com/collections/backpacks/products/the-backpack-pro) by Db
which wasn't bad but I had my complains. Thule was definitely an improvement although the number of internal compartements
seems to be excessive in comparison to Db. On the other hand, the main pocket doesn't open on it's own when heavily loaded.

## In The Bag

- [_Book_]({{< ref "/books" >}}). I Always carry one around, most of the time non-fictional books about
  economics, statistics, thinking, or programming. Sometimes I also read fiction but I tend to get very excited
  and hooked by the plot that fictional books don't spend more than 3 days in my bag.
- [Tech Kit](https://bellroy.com/products/tech-kit/looma_viroblock_standard/basalt) by [Bellroy](https://bellroy.com/).
  I would consider this an unnecessary luxury but it works fine and I hope it will last for a long time. As a bonus, it also looks good.
- [TriggerPoint](https://www.tptherapy.com/) [MBX](https://www.tptherapy.com/massage-balls/mbx-massage-ball.html)
  and [MobiPoint](https://www.tptherapy.com/massage-balls/mobipoint-massage-ball.html) massage balls. Perfect small companions
  for recovery. Sometimes I use the MobiPoint to massage my feet even at work, and when needed, it can be used to apply pressure
  to verious stiff areas. Works like a charm.
- Microfiber cloth to clean my glasses.
- Screen wipes to clean my laptop screen.
- [Humangear](https://www.humangear.com/) spork in case I bring a food with me that can't be eaten using the hand.
- [Nalgene](https://nalgene.com/) 1l bottle to keep hydratated.
- [Landgarten Chocolate Fruits](https://www.landgarten.at/en/product-category/schoko-naschfruechte/)
  bio organic chocolate + fruite snack. I like raspberry and ginger the most. Also, the packages are quite
  small so it never happens that you eat too much.
- [100% Konnor](https://100percent.eu/collections/konnor) sunglasses
- [Curaprox Travel Set](http://www.curaproxclub.cz/produkty/curaprox-travel-set-308/) in case I ever forget my hygiene kit or get stuck with just my bag.
  I haven't used the kit yet, which just confirms the rule of _it won't happen if you are prepared_.
- [Moleskin Hard Cover A4 notebook](https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/the-original/classic-notebook-black-8053853602848.html)
- [Aesop Resurrection Aromatique Hand Balm](https://www.aesop.com/de/en/p/body-hand/hand/resurrection-aromatique-hand-balm/)
