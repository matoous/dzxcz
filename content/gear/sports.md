Some notes after a few years of doing quite a few sports:

- When switching shoes (doesn't matter if running or cycling), don't go all in but alternate with your
  old shoes for at least first 2 weeks. Took me one heel inflammation and one knee inflammation to learn my lesson.

- Sadly, price correlates with quality and good gear costs money. Ideally have friends that work in the industry
  and can get you discounts or tips at least (easier said than done).

- If something works for you (e.g. certain brand of shoes fits you well) there's no reason to experiment, usually that
  ends with more harm than good.
