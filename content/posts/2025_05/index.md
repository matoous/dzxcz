For a video version that's further on the side of caution see [The 'Buy Now Pay Later' Trap, Explained](https://youtu.be/KkN6I3gZfGI?si=i3bjk-w9aihY_24e) by Grunt Rudow.

We are running [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/) at SumUp for last 2 years and it's nice to see more projects entering this space, hopefully leading to more competition and leaving everyone better off.
- [Trial by Fire: The crash of Aeroflot flight 1492](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/trial-by-fire-the-crash-of-aeroflot-flight-1492-ee61cebcf6ec), an investigative long-form article.

On 30th May we've received another company-wide email from our CEO. These emails are carefully crafted and usually touch on topics such as the company financials, priorities, departures of C-level people, or other noteworthy events. It's been 4 months since I wrote [The AI Madness]({{< ref "/posts/the_ai_madness" >}}), ranting about the AI narrative driven by our company's leadership that is detached of reality. I thought we were already low, but boy... was I wrong, the bottom was still far.

> From here on out, using AI isn’t just encouraged - it is expected

Whole teams are being disassembled, our eNPS survey results are again hitting record lows, yet the thing worth sharing with the whole company is _what tools one should be using to do their work_. One of the examples of AI use case in the email is "use AI to crunch performance data". What data? The data that is either so shit or completely absent that analysts are pulling their hair out until their either leave or give up out of desperation? There's a huge gap between reality and the mental model of LLMs that our leadership has built and it is widening by the day. If more productivity is what we desire, built a strong foundations to built on top of, create leverage for product teams, create a solid platform. That means properly staffed design system team, unified engineering standards (Jeff Bezos's [The Bezos API Mandate](https://nordicapis.com/the-bezos-api-mandate-amazons-manifesto-for-externalization/) comes to mind), and a mission that doesn't change every two quarters. We are consistently undervaluing fundamentals. Once we have that, I am fine with us throwing AI into the mix.

On the topic of LLMs - what doesn't seem to be stressed enough is its inability to say that you are wrong, that your idea is bad, or that you might be better off closing the AI tab for a while. Yes, faster development cycle and quicker prototyping is nice but what's even nicer is coming up with a solution that doesn't require new code in the first place. I hope time proves me wrong and LLMs become better, maturing from an unskilled junior to a thoughtful senior engineer, suggesting large-scale cleanups and taking care of refactoring and tech debt. In the meantime, embracing the inevitable, [Vibe Coding is not an excuse for low-quality work](https://addyo.substack.com/p/vibe-coding-is-not-an-excuse-for) lays down a solid framework for AI-assisted coding (the _vibe coding_ term gives me heebie-jeebies).
