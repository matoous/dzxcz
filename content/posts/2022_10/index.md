## Reading

- [Why I built a dictionary app](https://www.wordnote.app/blog/why-i-built-dictionary-app) - designing dictionary app from ground up.
- [How I regained concentration and focus](https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/wie-ich-meine-konzentration-wiederfand/)
- [Productivity Porn](https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2022/productivity-porn/)

  > Productivity porn is anything that after having been consumed makes you feel like you were productive when in reality you didnâ€™t actually do anything.
  
  I.e. saying "I learned something new" after 30mins of reading Hacker News is productivity porn.
  The key is that you benefit from doing the actual activity, but not from thinking about doing it.

- [Your DietBet Destroyed the World](https://davidlaprade.github.io/your-dietbet-destroyed-the-world) - fictional story about the world ends in an unusual twist.

## This month I learned

- _[Effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism)_ is a philosophical and
   social movement that advocates "using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others
   as much as possible, and taking action on that basis". People who pursue the goals of effective
   altruism often choose careers based on the amount of good that the career achieves while donating
   to charities based on maximising impact.[^1]
