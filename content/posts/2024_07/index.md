## This month I learned

- [Instrumental convergence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence)
  > Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent, goal directed beings (human and non-human) to pursue similar sub-goals, even if their ultimate goals are quite different. More precisely, agents (beings with agency) may pursue instrumental goals—goals which are made in pursuit of some particular end, but are not the end goals themselves—without ceasing, provided that their ultimate (intrinsic) goals may never be fully satisfied.
  is what [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) is about.

## Reading

[A Git story: Not so fun this time](https://blog.brachiosoft.com/en/posts/git/) is a wonderful tour through the history of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). Reading through I realized how little I know about origins of a technology that I use on daily basis. The most starkling realization was how humble the beginnings of it were; Git came to existance as a hack project of [Linus Torvals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) and look where it's now.

- [Stroads are Ugly, Expensive, and Dangerous (and they're everywhere)](https://youtu.be/ORzNZUeUHAM?si=vtpsfbtUAofGxKKi) - How combination or [_roads_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road) and [_streets_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street) negatively impacts street life, is dangerous, and results in ugly cities.
