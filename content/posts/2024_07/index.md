## This month I learned

- [Instrumental convergence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence)
  > Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent, goal directed beings (human and non-human) to pursue similar sub-goals, even if their ultimate goals are quite different. More precisely, agents (beings with agency) may pursue instrumental goals—goals which are made in pursuit of some particular end, but are not the end goals themselves—without ceasing, provided that their ultimate (intrinsic) goals may never be fully satisfied.

## Reading

[A Git story: Not so fun this time](https://blog.brachiosoft.com/en/posts/git/) is a wonderful tour through the history of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). Reading through I realized how little I know about origins of a technology that I use on daily basis. The most startling realization was how humble the beginnings of it were; Git came to existence as a hack project of [Linus Torvals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) and look where it's now.

[The Time I Built an ROV to Solve Missing Person Cases](https://suanto.com/2024/06/06/the-time-I-built-an-ROV-01/) is a multipart series about an amateur building a ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) to solve the disappearance of Jussi Peltola in central Finland.

## Watching

- [Stroads are Ugly, Expensive, and Dangerous (and they're everywhere)](https://youtu.be/ORzNZUeUHAM?si=vtpsfbtUAofGxKKi) , talking about the negatively impacts of _stroads_ (combination of [_road_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road) and a [_street_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street)) on street life, pedestrian safety, and the look of towns and cities.
