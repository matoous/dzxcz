Investing is the act of committing capital to an endeavor with the expectation of generating an income
or profit. Unlike consuming, investing earmarks money for the future, hoping that it will grow over time.

In other words, by investing we sacrifice part of our current capital in hopes of obtaining it back at
some future time presumably at higher value. Even better, the invested capital can yield profit
while being invested without the need for the value itself to grow.

## Investing over the course of history


## Assets

Currently, there are 4 major assets classes of investments. Two risky - housing and equities
and two relatively safer options - short-term bills and government bonds.

Housing wealth accounts for roughly one half of national wealth in typical modern economy.
Both housing and equities have high and similar yield, on average around 7% per year. Housing outperformed
equities until the end of WW2, since then equities have higher total gains but are much more
volatile, and their performance is more tied to the business cycle. Even though both housing
and equities have similar total gains they differ significantly in the source. For housing
the long term capital gains hover around 1% p.a., significantly lower than capital gains in
the stock market. Yet, the rental yield component of housing investment is higher and more stable
than the dividend yield of equities placing both returns on similar level.

Real returns on equities and housing were similar over the ages up until WW2. After the events of WW2 this
is no longer the case. Equities tend to raise and fall more frequently across the countries and sectors.

## Investing for common mortals

The market always goes up... unless it doesn't.
