Multi-day hikes with sleep-overs at serviced lodges/huts. Super easy booking and the trails are well-maintained.

## Weather[^1]

### Weather in October

Daylights savings typically starts around the end of September, which means in October you can enjoy longer days and lighter evenings. 

At the end of October is Labour Weekend. For many Kiwis, this long weekend heralds the start of the warm season and is the time when they take their first dip in the ocean or plant their tomatoes for summer. 

Many Great Walks also open in late October. This means the trails are safe to walk again and you can book nights at the comfortable Department of Conservation (DOC) huts. 

In Auckland, the average high temperature is 18¬∞C and the average low is 11¬∞C.

In Queenstown, the average high temperature is 15¬∞C and the average low is 4¬∞C.

### Weather in November

Late spring is a great time to travel in New Zealand. The weather tends to be pleasant and settled. Despite this, it's a quiet season for tourism so accommodation is plentiful. 

In November the weather is warming up and the days are getting longer, so you can start to enjoy beaches and coastal drives in the North Island. 

This is also the ideal time to visit popular national parks in the South Island, such as Aoraki/Mount Cook or Abel Tasman, before the summer crowds get there. 

In Auckland, the average high temperature is 20¬∞C and the average low is 12¬∞C. There are only seven days of rain on average. 

In Queenstown, the average high temperature is 18¬∞C and the average low is 6¬∞C.
