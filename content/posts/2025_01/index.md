Not much for January, a calm month, no travels, no side projects - an off-season for work. I will be back to posting when I feel like and have something to share, until then ðŸ‘‹

## Reading

William Strunk Jr.'s [The Elements of Style]({{< ref "/books/the_elements_of_style" >}}) is a quick read. The is century old at this point, but stands the test of time. Internet suggests it's inaccurate in parts, and outdated in others, but if nothing else - it's a good reminder of the very basics of writing well.
