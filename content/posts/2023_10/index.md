[Bosnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina) was a blast, from nature, to food and cities. I squeezed in a couple long runs, preparing for next season. We have spent the first half in national parks, traveling from [Banja Luka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banja_Luka) all the way down to [Mostar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostar). Last couple of days we have spent in [Sarajevo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo) and surroundings. Bosnia's nature was astounding and one can just wonder, how further could have it been be it not for the events at the brink of the century.

The rest of October was mostly in the name of work, except one weekend that we've spent we siblings in Berlin, welking, eating, sightseeing.

## Listening

[Viktor Sheen](https://viktorsheen.cz/) released new album, yet again in completely different style. As always, I found only 2-3 songs that I enjoyed on the first listen but expect to some more to grow on me as the time goes.
