The healthiest diets minimize, dairy, meat, eggs, and processed foods, and maximize fruit, beans, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. We could describe the latter as, real food that grows out of the ground. Dr. Greger gives us actionable advice on plant-based food, that can prevent the top causes of death in the USA, with a chapter dedicated to each ailment.

> the “best” diet is a theme: an emphasis on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and plain water for thirst.

> Theory is great, but Results matter. "One good test is worth a thousand expert opinions" in the words of Wernher von Braun. There are multiple Blue Zones around the world, noted for long life and health span, and while none of them were strictly vegan, none of them are particularly known for high meat consumption during the time the high health was observed. The best of Okinawa, with around 95% of calories coming from plant sources and hardly any fish, and Loma Linda, with a large vegan population.

- Berries are great source of antioxidants

## Conclusion

Our methodology of researching diets still isn't optimal and many studies contradict each other. Still, theme can be distilled
down from individual studies: 

But other than that, there seems to be a lot of other factors that contribute to overall health and longelivety:

* little smoking among population
* strong social bonds → observed to be beneficial to bodily defence against stress
* high engagement in agriculture and fishing jobs → high physical activity
* possible effects of genetics — high presence of FOXO3 gene
* 10-to-1 carbs-to-protein comsumption ratio, like in other particularly-long-lived populations – linked studies support the conclusion, though too early to judge definitively
* sweet potato, rather than rice, is high-consumption food in the Okinawan diet
* most of the diet is vegetables and fruits; meats and fish are rare
* calorie consumption is, on average, 13% lower than general population
* it is suggested that past the age of 65, protein consumption should increase
* studies suggest that plant-based protein intake have a more positive effect on the human organism than meat- and fished-based
* their diet is not the "elixir of youth", as multiple interacting factors may be in play
