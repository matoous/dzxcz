## Reading

[Accountability sinks](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/accountability-sinks) hits close to home and I think I will be ordering Dan Davie's [The Unaccountability Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unaccountability_Machine).

Other fun reads discovered through RSS subscriptions and Hacker News:

- [The carefulness knob](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/10/29/the-carefulness-knob/)
- [The Night Watch](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf) by James Mickens

## This Month I Learned

[Gall's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law):

{{<cite "John Gall (1975) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail" >}}
A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

## Watching

I will be ticking off one huge item on my bucket list this summer by racing [Badlands](https://badlands.cc/), a 800km +16.000m gravel race in Granada / Almer√≠a - Spain. No better way to get motivated for long training rides than by watching [Lachlan Morton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lachlan_Morton) record ride around Australia.

Another race I kept an eye on - the most grueling, brutal, and impossible race - is the [Barkley Marathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkley_Marathons) conceived by [Gary "Lazarus Lake" Cantrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Lake) (the man that's also behind [Big's Backyard Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big%27s_Backyard_Ultra)) and held at [Frozen Head State Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_Head_State_Park) in [Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_County,_Tennessee). This year, nobody finished, but documentary of [Jasmin Paris's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmin_Paris) finish last year (first woman to finish the race) is a worthwhile watch providing insight into just how tough and demanding the race is.
