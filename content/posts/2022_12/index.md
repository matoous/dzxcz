## Reading

- [Drowning in AI Generated Garbageâ€¯: the silent war we are fighting](https://ploum.net/2022-12-05-drowning-in-ai-generated-garbage.html)

  > The algorithms are already feeding themselves on their own data. And, as any graduate student will tell you,
  > training on your own results is usually a bad idea. You end sooner or later with pure overfitted inbred garbage.
  > Eating your own shit is never healthy in the long run.

## This month I learned

> _Longtermism_ is a philosophical position that focuses on the long-term consequences of actions and policies. It is a
> way of thinking that prioritizes the future over the present, and it often involves considering the potential impact
> of decisions and actions on future generations. Longtermists believe that it is important to consider the long-term
> consequences of our actions and make decisions that will have the greatest positive impact over the long term. This can
> involve prioritizing investments and policies that have the potential to bring about long-term benefits, even if they
> may not provide immediate or short-term gains.

## Watching

- [Dave Not Coming Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Not_Coming_Back) is a documentary about [Dave Shaw's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Shaw) death
  while retrieving a Deon Dreyer's body from 240m under water. I already read about the incident a few years ago in a long form artile titled
  [Raising the Dead](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/water-activities/raising-dead/) which is so well written that it felt
  like I am watching the documentary for a second time. I highly recommend both (or either), it's a story about passion, courage, grief,
  and limits of the human body.
