> way of thinking that prioritizes the future over the present, and it often involves considering the potential impact
> of decisions and actions on future generations. Longtermists believe that it is important to consider the long-term
> consequences of our actions and make decisions that will have the greatest positive impact over the long term. This can
> involve prioritizing investments and policies that have the potential to bring about long-term benefits, even if they
> may not provide immediate or short-term gains.
