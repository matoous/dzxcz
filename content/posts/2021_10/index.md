I ran my strongest run to date. 23.38 km, 423 m elevation gain, 4:40 avg. pace and 162 avg. heart rate.
I don't think I ever held my heart rate over 160 bpm for 1 hour, yet alone 1 hour and 48 minutes, and I hope I won't ever have to do that again.
The run was part of [Run Berounka Run](https://runberounkarun.cz/), a trail running relay following the Berounka river in south-western part of the Czech republic.
Verča invited me to the race 2 weeks prior so I had around 0 preparation in terms of long distance tempo running. But, I would be lying if I said
that more time for preparation would make me train for it. Either way, I enjoyed the race greatly. It was very different from any other race I did
up to date. The scenery, route, and perfect pacing all added up to the best run I ever had. In the end, we finished in 17th place out of 49 teams
and I had second best time on my segment. Looking forward to more running races next year, and maybe finally even the sub-3 marathon.

## Watching

- [Dune](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1160419/) by Denis Villeneuve, is this my new favorite movie? I am huge fan of Denis Villeneuve.
From Prisoners and Sicario, to Arrival and Bladerunner 2049, Denis is mastermind of storytelling and great visuals and now I can't wait for the part two to be out.
(Did I forgot to mention the score by Hans Zimmer?)
