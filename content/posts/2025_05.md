In May I raced my first gravel bike race - [Seven Serpents]({{< ref "/posts/seven_serpents_2025" >}}), race report in the linked dedicated pots. I didn't have Iris with me as a support this time (it's a self-supported race after all) but she, my family, and couple friends followed along remotely on [Follow My Challenge](https://www.followmychallenge.com/) (FMC). FMC seems to be the biggest provider of live GPS tracking for sport events (in EU) which comes as a surprise given their UI/UX quality which lead to an idea - how hard would it be to provide an alternative? As far as I understand, what FMC does is rent out GPS tracking devices ([Queclink](https://www.queclink.com/) GSM trackers, [GL320MG](https://www.queclink.com/product/gl320mg/) model specifically). They then provide a platform for [visualizing](https://followmychallenge.com/live-maps/) data from the trackers live during the race.

The trackers are priced at 27.50 - 32.50 € for up to 14 days of rental depending on the quantity. The GL320MG tracker itself can be purchase for under 50 $, theoretically paying for itself after 2 rent-outs. Quecklink devices are not sport-specific (their official description is "LTE Advanced Real-Time Asset Tracker") which leads me to believe that one could build a device optimized for sports. For example, with better battery life, allowing for either more frequent position reporting (the default on Follow My Challenge is 5 minutes) or longer race duration. The web platform could also be improved upon - more user friendly, embeddable, optimized for mobile devices, etc. I am certain there's a lot of hidden complexity that I don't see, so I got myself a [Walter](https://www.quickspot.io/index.html) - 4G/5G/GPS & ESP32-S3 in a single module to toy around with.

On 30th May we've received another company-wide email from our CEO. These emails are carefully crafted and usually touch on topics such as the company financials, priorities, departures of C-level people, or other noteworthy events. It's been 4 months since I wrote [The AI Madness]({{< ref "/posts/the_ai_madness" >}}), ranting about the AI narrative driven by our company's leadership that is detached of reality. I thought we were already low, but boy... was I wrong, the bottom was still far.

> From here on out, using AI isn’t just encouraged - it is expected

Whole teams are being disassembled, our eNPS survey results are again hitting record lows, yet the thing worth sharing with the whole company is _what tools one should be using to do their work_. One of the examples of AI use case in the email is "use AI to crunch performance data". What data? The data that is either so shit or completely absent that analysts are pulling their hair out until their either leave or give up out of desperation? There's a huge gap between reality and the mental model of LLMs that our leadership has built and it is widening by the day. If more productivity is what we desire, built a strong foundations to built on top of, create leverage for product teams, create a solid platform. That means properly staffed design system team, unified engineering standards (Jeff Bezos's [The Bezos API Mandate](https://nordicapis.com/the-bezos-api-mandate-amazons-manifesto-for-externalization/) comes to mind), and a mission that doesn't change every two quarters. We are consistently undervaluing fundamentals. Once we have that, I am fine with us throwing AI into the mix.

On the topic of LLMs - what doesn't seem to be stressed enough is its inability to say that you are wrong, that your idea is bad, or that you might be better off closing the AI tab for a while. Yes, faster development cycle and quicker prototyping is nice but what's even nicer is coming up with a solution that doesn't require new code in the first place. I hope time proves me wrong and LLMs become better, maturing from an unskilled junior to a thoughtful senior engineer, suggesting large-scale cleanups and taking care of refactoring and tech debt. In the meantime, embracing the inevitable, [Vibe Coding is not an excuse for low-quality work](https://addyo.substack.com/p/vibe-coding-is-not-an-excuse-for) lays down a solid framework for AI-assisted coding (the _vibe coding_ term gives me heebie-jeebies).
