A belated update for July from onboard a flight to Japan.

July has been a work-intensive month with a quick break in the middle. We met with the team in Koln for a 4 day long off-site and socializing which has been fun and productive but not nearly enough for us to cover all the topics we needed. I left on Thursday afternoon and on an early Saturday morning we were already on a flight to Italy to meet with my parents in a Tuscany for a week of sun, relax, and good food.
