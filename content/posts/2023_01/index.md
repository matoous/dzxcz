We've spent the whole of January in Tenerife with group of great friends (people) from the office.

## Reading

- [Mike Acton’s Expectations of Professional Software Engineers](https://adamj.eu/tech/2022/06/17/mike-actons-expectations-of-professional-software-engineers/).
- [Iteration isn't just for code: here are our latest API docs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-a-better-developer-experience-through-api-documentation/).
  Yet another reminder of how poor are we doing public APIs at SumUp.
- [Why are you so busy?](https://tomlingham.com/articles/why-are-you-so-busy/) - you should ever be so busy only on purpose.
- [It Hurts to Ask](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/rbenabou/files/ihta_august_7.pdf)
  > We analyze the offering, asking, and granting of help or other benefits as a three-stage game with
  > bilateral private information between a person in need of help and a potential help-giver. Asking
  > entails the risk of rejection, which can be painful: since unawareness of the need can no longer
  > be an excuse, a refusal reveals that the person in need, or the relationship, is not valued very
  > much. We show that a failure to ask can occur even when most helpers would help if told about
  > the need, and that even though a greater need makes help both more valuable and more likely to be
  > granted, it can reduce the propensity to ask. Furthermore, when potential helpers concerned about
  > the recipient’s ask-shyness can make spontaneous offers, this can turn out to be a double-edged
  > sword: offering reveals a more caring type and helps solve the failure-to-ask problem, but not
  > offering reveals a not-so-caring one, and this itself deters asking. This discouragement effect can
  > also generate a trap where those in need wait for an offer, while potential helpers wait for an ask,
  > resulting in significant inefficiencies.

## This month I learned

- [**Hedonism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) - Hedonism refers to a family of theories, all of which have in
  common that pleasure plays a central role in them. Psychological or motivational hedonism claims that human behavior is
  determined by desires to increase pleasure and to decrease pain.
- [**Preparedness Paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preparedness_paradox) - The preparedness paradox is the
  proposition that if a society or individual acts effectively to mitigate a potential disaster such as a pandemic,
  natural disaster or other catastrophe so that it causes less harm, the avoided danger will be perceived as having been
  much less serious because of the limited damage actually caused. The paradox is the incorrect perception that there had
  been no need for careful preparation as there was little harm, although in reality the limitation of the harm was due to
  preparation. Several cognitive biases can consequently hamper proper preparation for future risks.
