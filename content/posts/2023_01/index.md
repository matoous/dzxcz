We've spent the whole of January in Tenerife with group of great friends (people) from the office.
The coffee and pastries consumption was through the roof and apart from work we managed to squeeze in
a lot of fun as well: night hike to Teide, paragliding, surfing, and plenty of dinners, walks, and
deep talks. In short, I had fun, felt happy, and enjoyed the company. 32 days was admittedly a lot
and the productivity was on decline in last 2 weeks so one consideration for next iteration of the
_Winter Berlin Escape_ would be to make it shorted or take more days of full time off.

This month [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/) released their RFC management tool called
[Hermes](https://github.com/hashicorp-forge/hermes) and we had a long discussion about the absence
of a proper RFC process at SumUp. In my opinion this hinders cross-team collaboration,
undermines enforceability of company-wide standards, and makes it hard for non-senior engineers
to raise issues to higher ranks. The dream would be to have something like Oxide's [RFD 1](https://oxide.computer/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion)
and a management system that would consolidate RFCs from all tools that we use right now
(Confluence, Google Docs, GitHub) into single tool that would make it easier to discover,
follow, and reference RFCs.[^1]

  Yet another reminder of how poor are we doing public APIs at SumUp.
- [Why are you so busy?](https://tomlingham.com/articles/why-are-you-so-busy/) - you should ever be so busy only on purpose.

  > We analyze the offering, asking, and granting of help or other benefits as a three-stage game with
  > bilateral private information between a person in need of help and a potential help-giver. Asking
  > entails the risk of rejection, which can be painful: since unawareness of the need can no longer
  > be an excuse, a refusal reveals that the person in need, or the relationship, is not valued very
  > much. We show that a failure to ask can occur even when most helpers would help if told about
  > the need, and that even though a greater need makes help both more valuable and more likely to be
  > granted, it can reduce the propensity to ask. Furthermore, when potential helpers concerned about
  > the recipient’s ask-shyness can make spontaneous offers, this can turn out to be a double-edged
  > sword: offering reveals a more caring type and helps solve the failure-to-ask problem, but not
  > offering reveals a not-so-caring one, and this itself deters asking. This discouragement effect can
  > also generate a trap where those in need wait for an offer, while potential helpers wait for an ask,
  > resulting in significant inefficiencies.

## This month I learned

- [**Preparedness Paradox**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preparedness_paradox) - The preparedness paradox is the
  proposition that if a society or individual acts effectively to mitigate a potential disaster such as a pandemic,
  natural disaster or other catastrophe so that it causes less harm, the avoided danger will be perceived as having been
  much less serious because of the limited damage actually caused. The paradox is the incorrect perception that there had
  been no need for careful preparation as there was little harm, although in reality the limitation of the harm was due to
  preparation. Several cognitive biases can consequently hamper proper preparation for future risks.

## Watching
