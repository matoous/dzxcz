I am ashamed of how much I have forgotten of math in last year or two.
I am also ashamed of how much I neglected math during the whole university.
Math was always the secondary subject that I considered to be just an obstacle
of programming and while I enjoyed certain areas, especially [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)
and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) I was, and still am, lacking in others.

And would like this struggle to come to an end, so I decided to do a little math refresh and revisit
all I have learned since kindergarten up until now, focusing on topics that I know I have shortcoming in
and topics where I struggled the most (looking at you [Mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis))

To make the journey useful also to others, I decided to create a list of the resources that I found
interesting, helpful, and well written. That being a highly subjective measure take this whole list with
a grain of salt and in case of need refer to the _Additional Resources_ section at the bottom of the page.
