I'll be running [Val d'Aran Ultratrail](https://www.aranbyutmb.com/en/) on July 7th, 2 weeks after Ironman Frankfurt (duh).
The race is 105 km long, has over 6000 m elevation gain, and takes place on the Spanish side of [Pyrenees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees).
If I am able to finish the race, I will be able to enter the draw to participate in UTMB next year which would
be the ultimate goal. But, with that I am getting ahead of myself, first I need to get a lot of volume into the legs
that didn't even fully recovered from the cycling camp in Spain.

As a side note; I also got my entry in [Berlin Marathon](https://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/en/) and I still have my entry from
previous year to the [Prague Marathon](https://worldsmarathons.com/marathon/volkswagen-prague-marathon).
This year will be heavy and it's about the time for me to learn to recover properly which I hope
will be easier thanks to the new addition into my clever wearables; [whoop](https://www.whoop.com/).

How do we learn useful things?

* Observations (collect data, ask questions, find patterns)
* Models (build model & theory, try to explain, find out what's repeatable and what's random)
* Observations (verify predictions, find your error, confirm your theory)
* _repeat_

{{<cite "Eliud Kipchoge">}}
Everybody is free, in long runs you don't have captains, we don't have bosses but we have leaders and we expect everybody to be a leader in his own capacity and to be in charge of the long run. We don't train people to perform or finish long runs but we train people to be human beings when they are running around
