First week of August we spent in Portugal with the family close to Nazare, the pinnacle of surfing.
A nice whole-family vacation in a long time and I am glad for the time we were able to spent together.

Not much more intesresting sutff this month except maybe SumUp's Summer party that was a lot of fun
and I've got the chance to meet a lot of people physically after spending quite some time with them
in the Zoom calls. I also got introduced to the proper way of _brunching_. To my best knowledge,
proper brunch starts the day before when you need to acquire hangover and ensure that you get
only a few hours of sleep in order for the brunch to _hit_ just right. The brunch itself _must_
begin no earlier than at 12am, has to include _at least_ one alcoholic beverage, coffee, and meal
(anything more than 1 is welcomed but not mandatory). The conclusion is, I am definitely more of a
brunch person than lunch or dinner person. If you manage to do an activity before, your daily dose
of happinnes can be basically fullfilled by around 2 hours into the brunch and you have the rest of the
day to not do anything.

- [On owning a software problem](https://vickiboykis.com/2022/02/21/on-owning-a-software-problem/) - list of low-friction small thing that most people will not notice, but that when they do, it’s a sign of craftsmanship, expertise, and pride in your work.
  Notably:
  - Accurate documentation of a repo and an easy, reproducible way to run the project
  - Formatted and linted SQL statements
  - Editing typos and inaccuracies in old communications
  - Explaining acronyms and industry jargon when in an audience that might not be familiar with it, and being cognizant of when they’re in that audience
  
  But there's no dispute that everyone will find their own. For me this would for example be leaving comments

  It’s about a product’s quality being defined not by its substance but by its reminder of things that can’t be purchased.

> Bad coffee is the stuff you make a full pot of on the weekends just in case some friends stop by.
> It's what you sip when you're alone at the mechanic's shop getting your oil change, thinking about where your life has taken you;
> what you nurse as you wait for a loved one to get through a tough surgery.
> It's the Sanka you share with an elderly great aunt while listening to her tell stories you've heard a thousand times before.
> Bad coffee is there for you. It is bottomless. It is perfect.

## This month I learned

- [_Chesterton's fence_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Chesterton%27s_fence) - The principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood.
