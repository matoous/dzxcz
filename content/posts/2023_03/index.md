Another few days of cycling in Spain, then back home, a week of work, and we left for back-country skiing in Slovakia. After hectic January and February I was looking forward being back in Berlin and on my regular schedule. And brunches, I was really missing brunches.

{{<cite "_The Wisdom of Insecurity_ by Alan Watts">}}
We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.

  > As I opened my wallet, I considered whether I should risk using this fake ID on the Secret Service. It probably amounted to a real crime. I had my driver's license as well. But you only live once and only a few of us even get a chance like this once in our lives. So I handed him the fake ID. He noted and returned it. The Secret Service took an ID that said "Laser Safety Officer" with a photo of myself wearing an eyepatch.
