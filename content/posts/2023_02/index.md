Back to reading, writing, and _living_.

On 6th at 23:00 our final leg of the inbound flight from Tenerife finally landed in Prague. After almost 5 weeks we returned to the grey reality of mainland Europe, sub-zero temperatures, and windy weather. I welcomed the return. The long _workation_ made me realize that there's certain beauty to the mundanity of regular workdays and daily routines.

I din't stay long in Berlin and on Friday we already went backcountry skiing in Krkonoše. Reminder for future self - trying out shoes or skiing boots at home doesn't imply the same comfort on the slops, or when hiking or running. A lesson I learned 10 times and forgot 10 out of them.

On 18th we visited [Fine Bagels](http://www.finebagels.com/) with _Ena_. The place reassured me of what I thought for a long time - books are the best type of decor for any space. Furthermore, I am becoming devotee of bagels as a breakfast meal. The only contender being _Kimchi Cheese Waffle_ that I had a day after during a brunch with the Tenerife bunch. We might be back from Spain but the coffees and bagels are to stay (at least so I hope).

## Reading

I am finally back in the reading game, thanks in part to spending more time around friends that read a lot (and fast, which I envy greatly). I am ending February with 3 books on the scoreboard; [Staff Engineer]({{<ref "/books/staff_engineer" >}}) by _Will Larson_, [No Rules Rules]({{<ref "/books/no_rules_rules" >}}) by _Reed Hastings_ and _Erin Meyer_, and [High Output Management]({{<ref "/books/high_output_management" >}}) by _Andrew S. Grove_.

Now I am half way through another gem, [Stranger in a Strange Land]({{<ref "/books/stranger_in_a_strange_land" >}}), and I am finding the long lost delight for novels. And not just reading novels, but enjoying time by reading books that bring emotional joy and are not another mean to _feel_ productive.

  - Become intentional with how you spend your time and energy.
  - Clarify what are your goals and how they align with your company and team so you have a framework for how **not** to spend your time.
  - Focus on leverage instead of productivity. E.g. what are the multipliers of your work?
  - Focus on one thing and one things only.

## This month I learned

- [Anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. It is considered to be an innate tendency of human psychology.
