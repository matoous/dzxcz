## Reading

- [TWH#45: Against Overwhelm](https://hagakure.substack.com/p/twh45-against-overwhelm)
  - Become intentional with how you spend your time and energy.
  - Clarify what are your goals and how they align with your company and team so you have a framework for how **not** to spend your time.
  - Focus on laverage instead of productivity. E.g. what are the multipliers of your work?
  - Focus on one thing and one things only.

## This month I learned

- [Anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. It is considered to be an innate tendency of human psychology.

## Watching
