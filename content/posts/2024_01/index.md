[Heynote](https://github.com/heyman/heynote) is a fun new way on taking notes. I wonder what more could be build on top of this idea; one endless buffer for notes, links, and everything else. Maybe this would work as an approach for personally wiki as well? Specifically, I would like to be able to tag sections, save links, and use my helix key-bindings.
