What does my review of [2020]({{< ref "/posts/2020" >}}) has to say about this year?

> I hope to keep the pace even the next year and would love to pump those numbers up a little bit more.
  The goal is to run 1875km (5km a day), ride 3650 km (10km a day) and swim 365km (1km a day). Those
  targets are quite low because I don't want to stress myself and I will go for more either way.
  I would also love to run the sub-3 marathon and finish a full Ironman race.
  
_"run 1875km (5km a day)"_ done, _"ride 3650 km (10km a day)"_ done done, _"swim 365km (1km a day)"_ not even close.
_"sub-3 marathon"_ nope, I didn't even try, not sure if I would be able to pull it off but one way or the other
I have at least one marathon scheduled for this year (_[Volkswagen Prague Marathon, 8th May](https://www.runczech.com/cs/akce/maraton-praha-2021)_) so there's no more excuses. And last but not least
_"finish a full Ironman race"_ - I didn't, but as with the marathon I have a full distance Ironman scheduled
for this year (_[IM Frankfurt, June 26th](https://www.ironman.com/im-frankfurt-register)_).

I didn't follow the goals very closely but overall I am satisfied with my training this year,
I improved a lot in cycling and swimming. I am not sure where my running stands as of now as I did
only a [single running race](https://www.strava.com/activities/6087366353) this year (although it went well and I ran one of the best times).
But most importantly I rarely needed to persuade myself to train. I loved every single bit of it, even if it was raining cats and dogs, even
when I was tired and exhausted, even if I didn't feel well. I want to continue with this mentality. After all,
I am doing this for myself, and whatfor if not for enjoyment and happiness.

Here are my take-aways for next year:

* *Find a coach*. There's only so far I can improve with ad-hoc training. I always try to give
  the training some structure and split it reasonably between all the sports that I want to do.
  But naturally, I avoid things I am bad at and I do more of the things where I feel well and strong,
  such as long rides. I think having a coach, even if only for creating a training plan, would help
  me focus on my weaknesses and gain more from the sessions I do.
* *Improve the swim*. I came to terms with not beeing the biggest fan of swimming altough I enjoy it more
  as I improve. Yet, I am still terrible and slow and I don't feel confident swimming 3.8 km this year.
  I plan to join a few weekend training camps and swim at least a little bit more than the last year.
  The biggest achievement would be to swim at around 1:45 pace at the end of the year and have over 182.5 km.
* *Keep going*. This one is the most important one for me. I want enjoy the sessions the way I do now.
  I want to keep looking forward towards every training and every opportunity to test out what is my body able to do.
  This year with a slightly bigger focus on recovery and overall healthiness, but still pushing the limits.
