## The Bag

*[]()*

## Electronics

*[Apple MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/)*

*[iPhone 13 mini](https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/)*. I was split on whether to buy 13 or 13 mini when my trusty iPhone 7 stopped working.
After some back and forth the decision was made to opt for the smaller model. It's a phone and does the things that all other phones do.
It stays charged throughout the day (the previous one didn't), takes great pictures (the limit is currently my artistic sense, not the phone),
can navigate me wherever I need.

*[AirPods 3rd generation](https://www.apple.com/airpods-3rd-generation/)*. For a long time I refrained from buying expensive-_ish_ wireless headphones. I loved the basic Apple airpods that used to be inlcuded in the box.
When I broke the last ones that I got with my [iphone 7]() I switched to cheap [Seinheisser XXX](), the reasonale being that I will eventually leave them in
a pocket of my running shorts and wash them. Those were only for sports and at work I used their bigger sibling [](). Eventually, when iPods 3 came out,
I decided to give them a shot to see how they compare to their wired predecessors that I held so dear and it was a great decision.
I can't be bothered by wires again, ever. The sounds quality is stellar compared to what I had before and the Airpods already survived a few beatings
(dropped them second week after purchase on a bike at 40 km/h) which is another big plus. For me they strike nice balance between simplicity,
sound quality, and price and I most likely won't be migrating to anything else anytime soon.

*[Bellroy Tech Kit Compat](https://bellroy.com/products/tech-kit-compact/looma_weave/limestone#slide-0)* used to carry around chargers and cables in a organised manner. Previously I used to throw them inside the bag which
not only made it harder to utilize the full size of the back but it also shortened the lifespan of the cabels.
... fits perfectly all I need: MacBook charger, USB-C to lightning bolt cabel, Garmin Watches cabel, screen wipe, and accessories dock.
Best feature: if you open the bag it can lay flat on the table providing easy access to all its contents.

## Miscellaneous

*[a book]({{< ref "/books" >}})*. Always carry one around. 

*[Curaprox Travel Set](http://www.curaproxclub.cz/produkty/curaprox-travel-set-308/)* in case I ever forget my hygiene kit or get stuck with just my bag. I haven't used the kit yet, which just confirms
the rule of _it won't happen if you are prepared_.

*[Light My Fire Spork](https://lightmyfire.com/en/online-shop/sporks/spork-original-bio)* because everything can be eaten with a spoon and I like to snack on Skyr's whenever I travel.
I haven't used the fork part yet so a sponn would do just as fine. I am currently eyeing [titanium spoon]() as it wouldn't
absorb the color and smell of the food I use it for.

*[Pens]()*

*[Moleskin Hard Cover A4 notebook](https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/the-original/classic-notebook-black-8053853602848.html)*

*[Screen Wipes]()* as there's nothin worse than oily keyboard and fingerprints on the screen. In case of emergency
the wipes can be also used for plenty of other things.

*[Trigger Point MobiPoint Massage Ball](https://www.tptherapy.com/massage-balls/mobipoint-massage-ball.html)* to activate the feet muscle before run and massage them after. One can just roll the feet on it
in the office to keep them healthy. Sometimes I also use the ball to apply pressure to painful spots in the muscle tissue
which works well too.

*[Nalgene Bottle](https://nalgene.com/product/32oz-wide-mouth-sustain/?attribute_pa_color=aubergine&attribute_pa_filter-color=gray)*

*[Blistex lip balm](https://www.blistex.com/products/medicated-lip-balm/)*
