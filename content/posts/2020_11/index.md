This month I... didn't write the _Lately_ post. I didn't find the right opportunity
and mood to do so so I am writing this with one month delay. Out of the window goes
the regular writing while the memories are fresh.

I spent a night in -5 degress, wind, and snowy weather outside on the Holubník hill
in the Jizerské Hory. We went there for hike with Bára and her friends, and Floki,
cheerful, energetic collie. The talks about buying a dog in our family continue
but the concerns about _who will take care of the dog when the kids leave_ and 
_would we have enough time for it_ are still overweighting the rest.

I watched Kilian Jornet try and fail world record for 24 hour run which brought me to question:
_What is the best time to start 24h attempt?_ (for the record, they started around 10:00 or 11:00).
I couldn't find the answer anywhere.

We (I and my sister) already had almost all the gifts for christmas by the end of the month.
This makes for a chill and stress-less December (not that I would be stressed anyway
but I am definitely happy that we have this behind us sooner than later).

I most likely did also some other stuff but as already mentioned, I am getting back to this
post with a delay so I no longer remeber.

  In the late 1990s, venture portfolios began to reflect a different sort of future … 
  Venture investing shifted away from funding transformational companies and toward companies 
  that solved incremental problems or even fake problems …
  VC has ceased to be the funder of the future, and instead become a funder of features, widgets, irrelevances.
