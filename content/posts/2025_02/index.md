## Reading

[I Tasted Honda's Spicy Rodent-Repelling Tape](https://haterade.substack.com/p/i-tasted-hondas-spicy-rodent-repelling), and no, the title is not a metaphor, it's literally an article about licking Honda's Spicy Rodent-Repelling tape and is just as much fun as it sounds like.

Ava's [the ‘return to office’ lies](https://blog.avas.space/rto/) resonates well with my opinions on the _return to office_ policy. Fake positivism, more work, more responsibility, but hey - come to the office, socialize, waste your time on commutes, _we know the best_.
