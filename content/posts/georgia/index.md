🚧 Work in progress 🚧

In 2017 a friend of ours got an opportunity to work at the Czech Embassy in [Tbilisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi)
(Georgia) which she gladly took. Terka, a sister of my very good friend Dominik, went with her to take care of her children.
Soon after we were offered accommodation in case we decide to visit them which put all things into motion.
Not even a week after we had our plane tickets bought and already were planning the itinerary,
so that we could squeeze the most out of our 2 weeks in Georgia.

Planning our Georgia trip proved to be harder than we though as the tourism there is in its infancy.
We also wanted to spend most of our time trekking in mountains which we found even less information
about. In the end we had a list of a few places and things we would like to see but no concrete plan what so ever.
Our initial plan consisted of: 1 or 2 days in [Tbilisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi) to explore the capital.
2 to 3 days to visit and trek around [Lagodekhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagodekhi), easternmost town located
at the foot of the [Greater Caucasus mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Caucasus)
in the historical region of [Kakheti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakheti). 2 to 3 days for the
[Tusheti national park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusheti_National_Park) in the north-eastern part of the country.
We also wanted to visit the townlet of [Stepantsminda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepantsminda) from where
the third highest mountain of Georgia - [Mount Kazbek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kazbek) (5033m) can be seen.
We then planned to move to the west of the country and walk the hanging bridges over
[Okatse Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okatse_Canyon_Natural_Monument) located close to the town 
of [Martvili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martvili). Around Martvili there are two more points of
interest - [Martvili Canyon](https://nationalparks.ge/en/site/martvilicanyon) that is usually explored on boats and
[Martvili Monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martvili_Monastery). Not so far, near the town of
[Kutaisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutaisi), lays [Sataplia Strict Nature Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sataplia_Strict_Nature_Reserve)
and famous [Prometheus Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_Cave_Natural_Monument) which is over
11 km long (1060m are open to visitors). From Kutaisi, we planned to return to Tibilisi and catch our
flight home; back to Prague.

Spoilers alert, our plans changed quite a bit, and we didn't visit even half of the places mentioned
before. Nevertheless, we have seen and experienced a lot and remember Georgia as one of the best trips
up to this date.

## Tbilisi

Tbilisi is the capital and the largest city of Georgia. It has population of approximately 1.5 million people and lies on the banks of the Kura River.
Throughout history Tbilisi was a point of contention among various global powers, mainly because of its location on the crossroads between Europe and Asia.
Tbilisi is important transit route to this day.
