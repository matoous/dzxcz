I started building my personal knowledge base/wiki - [wiki.dzx.cz](https://wiki.dzx.cz/).
The wiki is heavily inspired by [_Everything I know_](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) by Nikita Voloboev,
although I initially planned to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for the purpose
it is missing sidebar for easy navigation.

April was in the name of sports. I finished with 27 active days for the total
of 67 hours, keeping the bar high after Mallorca. My Achilles tendon is soar
and running is still impossible or very unpleasant but slowly getting better.
On the other hand, my cycling performance is better by the day.

Oh, and we did this crazy thing.
Except my stomach protesting half the ride it wasn't as brutal as I expected, only long, very long.
I left Litomerice before 8:00, met with Vojta around 3 hours in, we had a quick stop for
a large bowl of pasta with tune and sauce and a coffee at Plzen at around 13:00
and we arrived at Doubravka at 19:30.

And I migrated this website to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) using their
new [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) service. Netlify was fine but
now I can have everything under one roof and Cloudflare has also some other cool
services I can't wait to try.

## Reading

- [Where Did the Other Dollar Go, Jeff?](https://blog.cloudandtree.com/2021/04/the-other-dollar/)
- [The real reason to end the death penalty](http://paulgraham.com/real.html) and this
  comment on HN that is quite on point:

  > This is the obvious reason, but of course there are many more: executions are quite expensive, they don't seem to actually deter crime, they're fundamentally pessimistic ("this person will never be useful to society"). Plus, they're kind of unnecessarily cruel: if we wanted to execute people painlessly we could just pump a room full of nitrogen and let the person drift off into unconsciousness and death relatively quickly and silently. But for whatever reason we don't do this, instead opting for spectacles of shooting the person or zapping them or injecting slow paralytics into their veins. My personal guess is that people like to watch for some sort of catharsis which a silent death doesn't give them, but of course I'm not necessarily in a position to judge this well.

  Luckily, capital punishment has been abolished in 1990 in Czech republic.

## Watching

- [Shadow and Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_and_Bone_(TV_series)) - not as dark as I hoped for it to be, nice filler between Witcher seasons nevertheless.
- [Draw with Tomm Moore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqq89MeZi30) - lesson by one of the animators behind [Wolfwalkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfwalkers)
