In Ironman, nutrition is called the fourth discipline.
In fact, in any endurance sport nutrition is as important as the performance itself.
Without fuel there's no energy and without energy you will [_bonk_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall).
This article is a breakdown of all that I was able to find about race nutrition for endurance athletes.
I started working on it after walking my 3rd Ironman run in a row.

## Nutrients

Before we dive deeper, let's first take a look at individual [nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient) that come into play during activity.

### Macronutrients

#### Carbohydrates

[Carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate) serve as an energy store.

Carbs come in different forms. The easiest way to think about these are as simple and complex carbs.

_Simple carbs_, also known as simple sugars, have one to two sugar molecules. These include glucose, dextrose, or fructose; they break down quickly in the body. Foods with simple sugars include fruits, milk, vegetables, table sugar, candy, and soft drinks. They supply energy but lack fiber, vitamins, and other key nutrients.

_Complex carbs_ have three or more sugar molecules. You'll find these in foods like beans, whole grains, whole-wheat pasta, potatoes, corn, and legumes.

Each gram of carbohydrate contains ~4 calories worth of fuel.

Runners who balance out their meal plates with 45-65% carbohydrate while meeting daily energy demands can expect to store about 2 grams (8 calories) of glycogen per pound of muscle tissue and an additional ~100-125 grams (400-500 calories) within the liver. This amount of glycogen supplies the energy needed to run for ~2 hours at a moderate intensity, making addition of carbohydrates necessary during long run efforts to avoid depletion and consequent dizziness (aka “bonking”) and profound muscle fatigue (aka “the wall”).

How many carbs should endurance athletes eat? There will be some differences based on the type and duration of training. The general rule is to increase carbohydrate consumption up to 70% of total daily calories to support the high volume of glucose needed for that level of physical activity.

Aim for approximately 1/4-1/3 your body weight (lbs) in grams each hour of training or racing beyond 45-90 minutes. For example, an 180-lb runner should aim for ~45-60 grams of carbohydrate each hour of training or racing. To maximize carbohydrate uptake into the muscles and extend endurance, choose products whose ingredient lists include multiple types of carbohydrate. Common carbohydrate sources used in sports foods include maltodextrin, glucose or dextrose, sucrose, and fructose. Common products used on race day include sports drinks, energy gels, energy bars, and energy chews.

- The carbohydrates that we are going to focus on are going to be those that are made up mainly of glucose, and to a lesser extent by fructose. This is because the intes?ne has fewer fructose receptors and therefore becomes saturated with large amounts of it, and this can trigger intes?nal discomfort.
- 30-90g per hour

##### Glucose

##### Fructose


#### Proteins

- On the other hand, protein provides us with the amino acids we need to mi?gate muscle damage caused by these long efforts.

- Post-Race: A range of 10-20 grams of protein taken immediately post-race is sufficient to support muscle repair and immune function post-event. Common sources include milk, meal replacement shakes, and specialized recovery sports drinks.

#### Fats

- Fats generally slow down gastric emptying and can make us feel heavy when we start the race.

### Micronutrients

#### Nitrates

- but roughly speaking they help slowing down the onset of fatigue

#### Fiber

#### Caffeine

#### Electrolytes

#### BCAA's (branched chain amino acids)

#### Antioxidants
