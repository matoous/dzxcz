## Reading

> The moon blew up without warning and for no apparent reason.

I finished [Neal Stephenson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson) [_Seveneves_]({{< ref "/books/seveneves" >}}) in 4 days over the Christmas holiday and loved it. Seveneves feels like 2 books in one. First part grounded in the science while the final chapter ventures further into the territory of speculative fiction. The book also leaves just enough loose ends to keep one thinking about it long after while at the same time providing satisfying end. It's no coincidence that it has an opening sentence that drags you in from the start and the tension doesn't let you put the book down for next few hundred pages.

This month's dose of longform journalism: [Masks, Smoke, and Mirrors: The untold story of EgyptAir flight 804](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/masks-smoke-and-mirrors-the-untold-story-of-egyptair-flight-804-42c788fcac2d) by [_Kyra Dempsey_](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com).

## Watching

I got nerd sniped learning more about aviation. After reading the _Hard Landing_ (still in progress) and admiring the magnificance of [A380-800](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380) on our way to and from New Zealand I went down the rabbit hole of of flight mechanics (e.g. [Airfoil](https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/) by [Bartosz Ciechanowski](https://ciechanow.ski)) all the way to [How YOU can land a passenger aircraft! 12 steps](https://youtu.be/ePDl1JNqjpM?si=G62ZrT7y2OUDf8jv).

The other deep dive this month was toying with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) and learning more about game development. The highlight of which is [Rendering Tiny Glades With Entirely Too Much Ray Marching](https://youtu.be/jusWW2pPnA0?si=Q3DBdH62XvVW8tgf) talk by [Tomasz Stachowiak](https://github.com/h3r2tic), one of the people behind [Tiny Glade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Glade).

Last but not least, Decembed is the time of the [Chaos Computer Club](https://media.ccc.de). I am still catching up with the most interesting talks, one that I finished though and enjoyed in particular is [Self Models of Loving Grace](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-self-models-of-loving-grace) by [Joscha Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joscha_Bach).
