10th to 19th June we were in Austria with a very familiar group of cycling friends (Ondra and David).
On Sunday we saw the MTB World Cup in Zell am See/Kaprun and the rest of the week we were cycling
almost every day. I managed to squeeze in a few swims as well; in a wonderful outside pool.
Last day we went for the classic _Queen Stage_, this time to GroÃŸglockner, and drove back home
on the same day to have full Sunday for recovery.

Week later, on 26th June, I finished my first [Ironman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon).
3.8km swim, 180km ride, and 42km run. It was long, exhausting, hard, but most importantly fun.

Suprisingly, the swim went smoothly. My worst discipline improved a lot in last 4 months and I
came out of the water fresh and ready for the 2 stronger disciplines which might have been a mistake.
I pushed hard (too hard) on the bike for the first half of the 180km and the rolling terrain with a lot
of steep small hills took its toll. On 100th kilometer I already knew that it will be a painful day.
I spent the rest of the bike in damage-control mode and tried to conserve as much energy as possible
for the run.

The run went horrendously. I started slowly at 4:50 pace and hoped to increase it slightly over
the course but that didn't pan out. At 16th km I completely bonked, I didn't have energy, my stomach hurt,
and it was very hard to consume any calories. I spent next 12km walking (even short jogs were impossible)
until I recovered at least a little bit. Last 12km were finally something one could call _a run_.

I _finished_ in 11:34:42. The heat made it one hell of a race as my heat tolerance is really low
and I am still trying to figure it out and get used to it. On the other hand, it was an invaluable experience.
I tried nutritioning on a really long endurance events. I tested out how fast can I go on the bike
(went too fast). And I gained some confidence in the water. Still, the event left me a little bit
dissatisfied so I decided to sign up for Ironman Barcelona in October.

> The problem is that firefighting is thrilling and addictive and makes you feel needed--and installing smoke detectors is boring.
> The problem is that you're really good at fighting fires.

> Everyone complains about how short life is, but that perspective is broken. Life is not short. The real issue is that we waste so much of it.

## Watching

- [Stranger Things](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/) are back with 4th season and whatever, I will admit it, I enjoy it.

## This month I learned

I read a bunch of articles on value of personal time and ended up on tool called
[_What is your time really worth to you?_](https://programs.clearerthinking.org/what_is_your_time_really_worth_to_you.html#.YtLHvS8RrfZ) -
that helps you estimate how much money each hour is worth to you.
My estimated value of free time is *â‚¬39 per hour* which seems about right or slightly lower
than if I tried to estimate it without the tool.

It is very useful to know the value of your free time.
It helps you make informed decisions in many situations such as:

* deciding whether to order groceries online (with premium and delivery) or go to store
* whether to take more expensive but shorter option of transport when traveling
* whether to take additional part-time work

and much more. This all needs to be taken with a grain of salt as personal preferences
come to play. Some people for example enjoy grocery shopping while others (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) don't mind waiting in a queue.
Either way, the worth of your time if an interesting data point in decision making and it might
make you reconsider a few decision here and there.

{{<details "More on the value of time and life">}}
[_Things you're allowed to do_](https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/) by
Milan Cvitkovic is a list of things that can done or bought that you might have never considered.
A few points that stand out to me: Treat fines like payments, e.g. park illegally and consider the
(expected value of the) fine to be the price of the parking. If you have the money:
buy clothes for appearance or comfort instead of just the lowest price,
buy your way out of advertising on e.g. Spotify or YouTube, use cleaning/laundry services.
And couple more points related to career and decision making.

## Listening

After a long time I had a few hours for podcasts while driving to Frankfurt, these
two were the best:

No groundbraking music discoveries this month. [Gleb](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleb_(raper)) (SK) release a new album that is... _underwhelming_.
Anyway, here's one of the songs I enjoyed this month:
