## This month I learned

- [Shirky Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky#Shirky_principle), [The Shirky Principle: Institutions Try to Preserve the Problem to Which They Are the Solution](https://effectiviology.com/shirky-principle/)

## Reading

Finished reading [_The Ministry for the Future_]({{< ref "/the_ministry_for_the_future" >}}), a thrilling mix of science, ecology, and fiction. It's a hefty book with 576 pages and unique style that works well with its premise.

## Watching

[Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)) by [Dan Harmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Harmon), co-creator of [Rick and Morty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty). It has a slow start but keeps getting better with every season.
