## Reading

- [Obituary for a Quite Life](https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2023/obituary-for-a-quiet-life)
- [Other peopleâ€™s problems](https://seths.blog/2024/04/other-peoples-problems/)
- [What will football look like in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/chapter-1). I am not even sure what to call this. It's a short story, wonderful website, it is something... different. Worth the read (and scroll).

## Watching

- [A THOUSAND SUNS - scifi short film anthology](https://youtu.be/vfHh07ziXsU?si=x2viiXMiZtSoPwVn)

## Listening

- [Sub Focus, Dimension, Culture Shock & 1991 | New York Livestream | WORSHIP x DNBNL x UKF On Air](https://youtu.be/2WxTPNdsCxU?si=Yi2r6K3OIEcZh4xf)

I wish these sets were on Spotify.
