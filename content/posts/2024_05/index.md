I've been spending time on side-projects[^wiki] [^esp32], skipping writing, and thus the monthly posts, yet again. A lot has happened in last few months, vacation, races, and more. The only part of this website I managed to tend to are the short posts in the [Atoms]({{<ref "/atoms" >}}) section which is better suited for random topics and low effort brain dumbs.

## Reading

- [What's new in CSS and UI: I/O 2023 Edition](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/whats-new-css-ui-2023/) - some exciting new things comming up, most importantly - CSS nesting! Once the adoption picks up, we won't need SASS and SCSS tooling everywhere (or so one would hope).
- [Obituary for a Quite Life](https://bittersoutherner.com/feature/2023/obituary-for-a-quiet-life)
- [Other peopleâ€™s problems](https://seths.blog/2024/04/other-peoples-problems/)
- [What will football look like in the future](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/chapter-1). I am not even sure what to call this. It's a short story, wonderful website, it is something... different. Worth the read (and scroll).
- [We Need To Rewild The Internet](https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/)
- [He Lost $36 Billion in a Week. Now Bill Hwang Is Fighting to Avoid Prison]
- [Development notes from xkcd's "Machine"](https://chromakode.com/post/xkcd-machine/) by Max is a writeup of the 15th annual April Fools project by [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/). The project was a huge [Rube Goldberg machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) build from submissions of the readers.

## Watching

- [A THOUSAND SUNS - sci-fi short film anthology](https://youtu.be/vfHh07ziXsU?si=x2viiXMiZtSoPwVn) is a series of youtube videos by A Thousand Suns studio. Similar in concept to [Love, Death & Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Death_%26_Robots) with every short film in a completely different settings. For the youtube format, the films are of exceptional quality and I would love to see what could be achieved with similar concept in longer form.

## Listening

- [Sub Focus, Dimension, Culture Shock & 1991 | New York Livestream | WORSHIP x DNBNL x UKF On Air](https://youtu.be/2WxTPNdsCxU?si=Yi2r6K3OIEcZh4xf). I wish these sets were on Spotify so I can listen to them on my runs, but I am yet to find justification for paying for YouTube subscription.
