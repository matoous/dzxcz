{{<cite "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-form_journalism)">}}
Long-form journalism is a branch of journalism dedicated to longer articles with larger amounts of content.
Typically, this will be between 1,000 and 20,000 words.
Long-form articles often take the form of creative nonfiction or narrative journalism.

{{<cite "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-at-large)">}}
An editor-at-large is a journalist who contributes content to a publication.
Sometimes such an editor is called a roving reporter or roving editor.
Unlike an editor who works on a publication from day to day and is hands-on,
an editor-at-large contributes content on a semi-regular basis and has less of a say in matters such as layout,
pictures or the publication's direction.
