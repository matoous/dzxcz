I found myself working on a side project. Again.
This time it is not just me though so there might be a
product at the end and not just yet another forgotten
repository on GitHub. Will write more about that soonâ„¢...

Oddly enough, the first larger issue we encountered is documentation
sharing. We are iterating fast as we are in the first stages
of the product development, specifications change under our
hands and so does everything else. This is my take on the current
state of documentation for APIs.

## What works

I have seen multiple times the [Stripe API docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api)
mentioned as an example of how API docs should be done. Other popular
produts with great documentation include [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/search/overview),
[Twillio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api), and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api)
to name a few. On the other hand, articles talking about bad api documentation
often mention [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/),
[PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/), and
[Steam](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview).
The quality of the documentation is a subjective matter but lets try
and draw from the examples what makes works and what doesn't.
