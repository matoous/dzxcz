This was my last month at [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com). After almost 2.5 years I am bidding farewell
and starting a new journey at [SumUp](https://sumup.com). While I don't feel particularly moved
by leaving I am incredibly grateful for the time I spent at Kiwi.com. I learned a lot,
gained a lot of experience and most importantly, bootstrapped my career.



I write less than I would like to. Not because I don't have things to write about

The wiki is slowly growing...
