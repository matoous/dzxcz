This was my last month at [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com). After almost 2.5 years I am bidding farewell
and starting a new journey at [SumUp](https://sumup.com). While I don't feel particularly moved
by leaving I am incredibly grateful for the time I spent at Kiwi.com. I learned a lot,
gained a lot of experience and most importantly, bootstrapped my career.

Returning old laptop and migrating to new one left me with a few precious files less.
I'm considering backing up the whole laptop to one place or the other, so far,
[Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html) seems like an optimal solution for me.
I wrote a short [post]({{< ref "/posts/back_up_your_macos" >}}) summarising current options
for periodical MacOS backups.

This month I started learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to extend my portfolio
of languages at hand. So far I enjoy rust greatly, it plays well into my weakness for
fast, clean, concise, compiled languages. I started by implementing the
[Tiny Renderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) which serves as a nice tiny intro into
how OpenGL and software rendering works. I wanted to try this project myself for a long long time
and by writing the solution in rust instead of C++ I can kill two birds with one stone.
I made my solution public on GitHub: [matoous/runderer](https://github.com/matoous/runderer)
and will come back to it later to fix all the issues and bad practices when I have more experience
with rust.

## Reading

- [Mailbag #2](https://waitbutwhy.com/2021/04/mailbag-2.html), AMA by _Tim Urban_.

## Watching

- [Love, Death & Robots volume 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Death_%26_Robots), sadly underwhelming
  after the bar set by the first season. I mostly miss the deeper stories of the volume 1 such as
  _Beyond the Aquila Rift_ or _Zima Blue_, volume 2 had only a few memorable episodes,
  specifically: _Pop Squad_, _Snow in the Desert_, _All Through the House_, and _The Drowned Giant_.
  Anyway, not all hopes are lost as volume 3 is already confirmed and in making.
