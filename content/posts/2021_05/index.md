This was my last month at [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com). After almost 2.5 years I am bidding farewell
and starting a new journey at [SumUp](https://sumup.com). While I don't feel particularly moved
by leaving I am incredibly grateful for the time I spent at Kiwi.com. I learned a lot,
gained a lot of experience and most importantly, bootstrapped my career.

Returning old laptop and migrating to new one left me with a few precious files less.
I'm considering backing up the whole laptop to one place or the other, so far,
[Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html) seems like an optimal solution for me.
I wrote a short [post]({{< ref "/posts/back_up_your_macos" >}}) summarising current options
for periodical MacOS backups.

I write less than I would like to. Not because I don't have things to write about

The wiki is slowly growing...

This month I started learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to extend my portfolio
of languages at hand. I will write more about rust when I have something to show but so far
I enjoy the language, it plays well into my weakness for clean, concise, compiled languages.
