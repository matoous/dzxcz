The start of January was hectic. Several school projects that I left hanging needed to be done
in a short period of time. I spent whole first weekend of January catching up Blockchain and TLS homeworks
for Cybersecurity labs and a few afternoons drawing scratches for the Art class.
Anyway, hell or high water I still squeezed in 2 weeks of ski touring in Krkonoše in terrific conditions.
In the typical Krkonoše manner the ridges were cold and windy but a few meters lower
we had better conditions than in the Switzerland. Tone of powder, great visibility and only a few
other enthusiast cutting their way up for the minute of glory on the way down.

The 2021 is going well so far. I am running 10k per day so far, writing slightly less than desired,
skiing more than I hoped for, being considerate of my spendings, and still enjoying every day
like there's no other.

Although not a formal mental-health diagnosis, duck syndrome has mostly
been described in college or graduate students and refers to the situation
in which the sufferer looks completely calm on a superficial level
while in reality they are frantically trying to keep up with the demands of their life.
Duck syndrome often indicates that the person experiencing it is suffering from clinical depression,
anxiety, or another mental illness.

### Reading

* [_How to Do Nothing_]({{<ref "/books/how_to_do_nothing">}}) by Jenny Odell, I like the writing slightly
  more with every page that I read.
  Certain ideas in the book are too abstract for me to grasp but other concepts seem to resonate
  with me. For example the phenomena of _Context Collapse_. Context collapse describes how our internet
  self is usually the lowest denominator because we are sharing with broad spectrum of people
  and want to please everyone. Example in the book mentioned following situation:
  imagine that you return from lengthy vacation abroad in an exotic country and want to tell someone.
  You would tell the adventurous and humorous version to your friends,
  slightly less inappropriate version to you parents,
  and informative and shorter version to your grandparents. Now with our social media reaching all of these
  groups we are constantly thinking up things that would go over well with all of them instead of saying
  the right things to the right people. _How to Do Nothing_ presents more such ideas to think about.
* [_The Three-Body Problem_]({{<ref "/books/the_three-body_problem" >}}) by Liu Cixin, brilliant fictional
  book with deep philosophical and scientific reach that definitely earned its
  place on the list of my most favorite books.
* _Growth_ by Vaclav Smil, had this book in queue for quite some time, now it's
  time for it to live up to the expectations.
* [Chemistry of Cast Iron Seasoning: A Science-Based How-To](http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/)
  tl;dr: start with linseed oil, rub the pan, bake, rinse and repeat.
* [Cameras and Lenses](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/) one great article for in depth understanding
  of cameras and lenses. Also the best interactive examples in an article I have ever seen.
