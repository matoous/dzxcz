## This month I learned

_Horses for courses_ - used to say that it is important to choose suitable people (or items) for particular activities because everyone has different skills[^1].

{{<cite "[edw519](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1084127)" >}}
A smart accountant once told me that the answer to "How much money did you make?" is always, "Who wants to know?"
If it's an investor, the answer is "A lot."
If it's a customer, the answer is "A little."
If it's the IRS, the answer is "None."
