I was there, on [r/wsb](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), during the $GME
boom. For two weeks my Reddit feed didn't contain anything else than GME memes, calls to arms,
and too many posts of people betting their life saving on Robinhood.

Czech Republic is breaking all records regarding Covid-19. Here we are, small,
insignificant, middle-European country ranking top in at least something except
beer consumption. And while many countries are slowly returning to regular life,
Czech republic is in despair taking further measures to put a stop to the hyperbolically
growing number of cases. We are going into the March with the country being
locked up to individual districts. Vaccination is super slow and would be
probably even slower haven't we received dontaions from neighboring countries.
And last but not least the only thing left after _Chytrá karanténa_, _E-Rouška_,
_Polní nemocnice_, _PES (Protiepidemický systém)_, and other government projects
that should have helped with the situation is the largest budget deficit up to date.

### Reading

This month was in the spirit of coding and programming. I read the whole documentation
of Hashicorp [Waypoint](https://www.waypointproject.io/). It's still pretty young but very
interesting technology that aims to _"provide a modern work flow to build, deploy,
and release across platforms"_. As with anything else by Hashicorp it is just wonderful
piece of software. Waypoint is in it's infancy and under heavy development
but it will be interesting product to watch.

As I spend a lot of time working I wasn't quite in the mood for books, on the other hand
I found a couple of interesting articles. Here are the ones that I enjoyed:

* [How GMOs can save civilization (and probably already have)](https://medium.com/impossible-foods/how-gmos-can-save-civilization-and-probably-already-have-6e6366cb893).
  I was searching for the ingredients used in the vegan alternatives to meat and this article popped-up.
  The subject of GMO is also mentioned in _Growth_ by Vaclav Smil and both of these sources seems to
  pretty much agree on one thing: If we want to feed the whole planet GMO is the solution.
* [Maersk, me & notPetya](https://gvnshtn.com/maersk-me-notpetya/) by _Gavin Ashton_. When world
  largest shipping company and a malware meet.
* [You Can’t Kill the Bloomberg Terminal. But If You Were Going to Try, Here’s How.](https://marker.medium.com/why-its-hard-to-kill-the-bloomberg-terminal-61073482e496)
* [Why Forgiving Someone Else Is Really About You](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/28/896245305/why-forgiving-someone-else-is-really-about-you)
* [Invert, always, invert](https://www.anup.io/2020/07/20/invert-always-invert/)
* [dorking (how to find anything on the Internet)](https://www.alec.fyi/dorking-how-to-find-anything-on-the-internet.html)
* [Robinhood and How to Lose Money](https://themargins.substack.com/p/robinhood-and-how-to-lose-money)
* [How I cut GTA Online loading times by 70%](https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/)

### Listening

* [The Kid Laroi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_Laroi). It's not everyday you listen
  to the same artist as your 15 years old sister.
* [Orphée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orph%C3%A9e_\(album\)) by [Jóhann Jóhannsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3hann_J%C3%B3hannsson),
  last album of Icelandic composer who worked on original scores of many of my favorite films.
* [Hello 2021: Maduk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9KkBlvaBzE&ab_channel=LiquicityEvents)
  on repeat.

### Coffee

* Ethiopia - Aricha by Zrno44, friend of a friend started a roastery and offered
  samples from the very first batch. Not as acidic as I like but for a first batch?
  Job well done.
* Ethiopia - Koke by [Nordbeans](https://www.nordbeans.cz/en/). By Nordbeans standards
  nothing overwhelming.

Based on recent experience, Ethiophia is not quite my _cup of coffee_ (all puns intended).
