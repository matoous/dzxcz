I missed this month and am backfilling a few notes with a large lag. In September we had a company hack-week in Bulgarie, continuing our work on the [developer portal](https://developer.sumup.com) that we started last year. We added self-provisioning of test accounts, rewrote the website in [Astro](https://astro.build/), and added custom [rendering of OpenAPI](https://developer.sumup.com/api) specs.

At the end of the month we flew to Bosnia for a 10 day vacation.

## Reading

- [Where does my computer get the time from?](https://dotat.at/@/2023-05-26-whence-time.html) - slides from a talk about computer time and [NTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5905). Computers have precise time thanks to a chain going from NTP Servers, satellites, all the way to US Naval Observatory, atomic clocks, and a lot of scientist making sure that clock stay in sync with actual earth position.
  - [NTP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol)
  - [PTP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol)

## This month I learned

- [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) - _"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"_.
