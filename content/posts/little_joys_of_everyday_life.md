Everyone has theirs _everyday joy_, be it cup of good coffee in the morning, snack from the favorite bakery,
or midday walk in the beautiful park near their office. These things seem so banal and casual, that we often
tend to overlook them or take them for granted. Yet, they are often privilege of our modern lifestyle;
we should be grateful for them and enjoy every bit of our _joys_.

## Comfy T-Shirts

Recently I fell in low with long-sleeved T-shirts, there's just something comforting about the long
sleeves that I really enjoy. I got a few pieces of [Patagonia's](https://www.patagonia.com/home/) Capilene Cool Daily Shirts and now
I wear them almost all the time and consider buying a few more.
Bonus - if you have only single type of t-shirt in multiple colors picking what to wear in the morning gets much easier.
As with many other things, I think this is just a period of my life that will be gone sooner or later
but for now, long sleeved t-shirts are my favorite piece of clothing.

## Tea & Coffee

I tried to stop drinking coffee which slowly turned into replacing the coffee with black and green tea.
Then I started drinking coffee again but didn't stop drinking the tea that I got used to. Now I drink both
in quite large doses on daily bases. For breakfast, I usually have english breakfast tea. After lunch,
I treat myself an aeropress coffee, or if I am not at home I usually buy a cup of batch brew; and in the evening,
I prefer light and zesty taste of M&S Empress tea.

## Writing tools

Throughout my school years I've always written with the cheap and crappy marketing pens you get
as an unwanted gift with some other item, that you bought or received. I think using them and not throwing
them away right away is a generous gesture... that sadly isn't worth it. A few years ago I discovered
Japanese company [uni-ball](https://uniballco.com/) which produces one of the best functional and affordable
writing instruments you can get. My little obsession started with their [Kuru Toga](http://web.archive.org/web/20200527031320/https://uniballco.com/uni-products/kuru-toga/)
mechanical pencil and got out of hand with their [Jetstream pens](http://web.archive.org/web/20200206161827/https://uniballco.com/uni-products/jetstream-rt/).
Both of these tools are superior to anything else I have ever used, yet cheap.
The Jestream pen is reliable and doesn't dry out. The first one I had and enjoyed the most was the 0.38mm wide one
with black ink. Sadly, they don't produce this size anymore and only wider 0.7mm and 1mm point sizes are available.
Nevertheless, with little bit of scepticism and hesitation I finally order the 0.7 sized pens when I
finished my last 0.38 and I enjoy them none less. So, if you write a lot, have a few bucks to spare, and want
to do yourself a favor; order yourself some uni-ball Jestream pens.
