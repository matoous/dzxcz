### Reading

Not much. I am still slowly reading _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ by Thomas Piketty, and by _slowly
reading_ I mean I haven't touch it for a month or so. Other book that is taking me quite some time is
_How to Do Nothing_ by Jenny Odell, it's a nice read about the modern obsession about productivity,
[FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) and more. I like the ideas in the book
but they are all hidden somewhere inbetween paragraphs of unnecessary philosophical thoughts
that make for a slower read (as ironaical as it is, I guess it might be intentional, you can't just
effectively speed throughout the book).

* [The Shipbreakers](https://www.wesjones.com/shipbreakers.htm), whenever in need of a great thrilling read,
  William Langewiesche is there to cover. This time with a story from the biggest ship graveyard in the world.

### Coffee

This month I had:

* Etiopie – Sahille by [Zoban](https://prazirnazoban.cz/), nicely aciding but flat in flavor, not great, not terrible (judging by Zobans standards, so still a superb coffee)
* Šumava (Costa Rica) by [Doubleshot](https://www.doubleshot.cz/), drinked in the evenings in Switzerland Alps,
  I had only a few cups in field conditions but liked it a lot. Might consider trying more beans by Doubleshot
  in the future.
* Burundi by [Kavaprodej](https://www.kavaprodej.cz/), this is the go to _"I want coffee but don't care that much
  about the taste so I might as well drink something cheaper"_ brand.
  It has mild-ish taste but great value for money.
