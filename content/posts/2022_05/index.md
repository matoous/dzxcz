On 8th May I ran my [second Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/7107250564) after 2 years.
I went into it with _simple_ goal of finnishing under 3 hours, not very confidently
to be honest, and I managed to do so by the margin of 10 seconds.
It was hard, and long, but most importantly hard. First 30k went smoothly
but every easy kilometer made me more afraid of what is to come in the last 12k
where everything is decided. Last 11k were the hardest and last 6k I my quads
were in cramps.

The best decision was slowing down in the initial kilometers when the pacer
for 3:00:00 time ran at higher pace around 4:05 min/km. And it paid off over
the course of the Marathon when many people started slowly fading out while
I kept my steady pace. I am very happy with the result, although I probably won't aim
for anything faster anytime soon. (with Berlin marathon in September I am sure I will
change my mind though).

Special thanks goes to Dominik who supported me during the Marathon and made this whole
thing work.

Second week of May we had Hack Week with SumUp in Portugal.
Initially, I was hesitant to come but now I am _very_ glad I did.
It was incredible. We had awesome team and worked on the [SumUp for Developers](https://developer.sumup.com/)
project trying to bring our public API to better shape.
I met a lot of people that I knew until this point by just their Slack handles
and everyone, without exceptions, was friendly and fun to talk with.[^0]

Week of socializing was more than I did cumulatively over last 2 years.
Little step outside of the comfort zone but I learned a lot of intersting life
stories of colleagues, something we wouldn't usually talk about during our
daily interactions. I build respect and admiration for many of the people I met
and it left we contemplating: _what do I want to do with my life?_

On 21st and 22nd we raced the [Run Labe Run](https://runlaberun.cz/) race. 377.5 km relay
along the Labe river in team of 9 people. Everyone had 4 segments of varying length
from short easy segments at around 7km, to hilly long segments of 14km+.
We placed 9th out of 83 teams which is incredbile and we had a lot of fun.
I managed to run my 5k and 10k PB at 18:57 and 38:57. The race was tough, I ran
most of the segments at >163 BPM and managed to get 2:30 hours of sleep during the weekend.
On the positive note it was a great leg-check before the Val d'Aran which now seems
harder than ever, but hopefully doable.

By the way, I started putting down my personal wishlist called [Before I Die](/before_i_die).

## Watching

- [Ironman World Championship St. George](https://youtu.be/0fzbrEESdJY) was fun and motivated me before the marathon I had next day.
- [Don’t chase happiness. Become antifragile | Tal Ben-Shahar | Big Think](https://youtu.be/e-or_D-qNqM)
- [Love, Death & Robots](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9561862/). After not-so-good 2nd season Love, Death & Robots earned my
  respect again. The third season is dark, fabulous, and original. My favorites were Bad Travelling, The Very Pulse of the Machine, Mason's Rats, and Jibaro.
  Although, Zima Blue is still the overall winner.

## This week I learned

- [Bosnian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War), which was quite heavy read.
  I am not sure whether we skipped this topic during our history lessons in highschool or
  I just wasn't paying attention.
- _jet-setter_ - a rich, fashionable person who travels a lot
- [Apple’s hidden flight tracker app ](https://medium.com/macoclock/apples-hidden-flight-tracker-app-397982fcc0d)

## Listening

Can't belive I am admitting it but I am now listening to techno DJ set by a colleague
of mine on repeat: [dunkeltudeln with hrmny @ VidaMar in Portugal](https://soundcloud.com/forsakenharmony/dunkeltudeln-vidamar-portugal-2022-05-14).

Other than that I enjoyed following songs this month:
