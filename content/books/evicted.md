I got Evicted after going through [Tom MacWright's](https://macwright.com/) top rated books, not knowing what to expected.

Desmod's _Evicted_ is a collection of stories of people living on the edge of poverty focusing on the threat of evictions. Desmod closely follows stories of people living in _Milwaukee_, throughout their struggle to keep a roof over theirs, and theirs children, head. It illustrates many things that are wrong about the socialism in USA, from ill-setup support programs to a system that makes it neigh impossible for people to get back on their feet.

_Evicted_ ends with a few suggestions for a better system for people and the government, for both of whom the existing system is expensive, inefficient, and outright broken. The only beneficiaries of status quo are landlords, often robbing the country of its money, and people of their prospects of a stable life.
