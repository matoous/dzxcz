From child mortality rates as a nation development indicator to the impossibility of net-zero by 2025 _Numbers Don't Lie_ summarizes many facts and numbers that drive our world in 71 short chapters. It's similar in content to Vaclav's [_How the World Really Works_]({{<ref "/books/how_the_world_really_works" >}}), just quicker and more approachable.
