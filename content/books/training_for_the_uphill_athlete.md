Training for the Uphill Athlete is book focusing on the endurance athlete physiology and training
written by the biggest names in the field. First chapter breaks down the important scientific concepts behind sporting
such as aerobic capacity, VO2max, and heart rate zones. Chapter two talks about the methodological basis of endurance
from training volume, to testing and recovery. Chapter three is about strength training that is important
part of race preparation even for endurance athletes. And in the last - fourth section - one can find
examples of training plans for different parts of the season and generic tips for structuring yours plan
as there's no one-size-fits-all.

## Notes

- As with all other sources: focus on the base, 80% of training should be in Zone 1-2.
- Strength training is meaningful (a lot) even for endurance athletes.
- 4 week blocks with 3 weeks of intensity and one recovery work well.
- There are great recommendations for training plans in the book that wouldn't fit here.
