_Thinking, Fast and Slow_ is a book by _Daniel Kahneman_ that explores the ways in which the human mind processes
information and makes decisions. The book is divided into two parts, each focusing on one _system_ of the human thinking.

"System 1" is fast, automatic, and effortless, and is responsible for intuitive and emotional responses. It is the part
of the brain that we use when we quickly and automatically react to stimuli, such as when we reflexively jump out of the
way of a speeding car. It's also the part responsible for most of our cognitive biases.

"System 2", on the other hand, is slow, deliberate, and effortful, and is responsible for logical and rational thinking.
It is the part of the brain that we use when we consciously and deliberately think through a problem or decision.

Throughout the book, Kahneman uses a wide range of examples and experiments to illustrate the ways in which our two
systems of thinking can influence our decision-making and behavior. He also discusses the various biases and heuristics
that can affect our thinking, and provides practical advice on how to avoid common pitfalls and make better decisions.

Overall, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a fascinating and thought-provoking book that offers valuable insights into the
human mind and how it processes information. For me it falls into the same (now already pretty large) category of _must-read_
books such as [Factfulness]({{< ref "/books/factfulness" >}}), [Enlightement Now]({{< ref "/books/enlightement_now" >}}),
or [Nonviolent Communication]({{< ref "/books/nonviolent_communication" >}}).
