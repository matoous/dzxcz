## Notes

- _Comparative Advantage_ - the idea that countries should do what they are
  _relatively_ best at doing. Oposed to _Absolute advantage_ it suggests
  that even if one country is _absolutely_ best at producing everything
  it will still end up specializing in the product where they have _comparative advantage_.
