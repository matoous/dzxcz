In 15 extensive chapters Steven Pinker makes a case for reason, science and humanism.
Each chapter describes a measure of civilization well-being, be it life expectancy,
quality of life, safety, education and more. Each chapter is supported with ton of data
digested to memorable and compelling form, with plenty of charts and graphs that make
it ever so easier to make sense of otherwise unrelated numbers.

_Enlightenment Now_ is optimistic, light, and brilliant read showing the progress of our species
throughout the decades, explaining why we are instead drawn to the pessimism and how
we choose to believe that the world is getting worse by day. In certain ways this book
is similar to [_Factfulness_]({{< ref "/books/factfulness" >}}) by Hans Rosling but emphasizing more
the data and context to back up the signs of progress in each chapter. _Enlightenment Now_
left me knowing, that the world is getting better even though it doesn't always have to feel
this way.
