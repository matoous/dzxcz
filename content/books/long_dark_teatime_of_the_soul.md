I bought _Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_ in Bucharest while visiting for a wedding. I loved Adams's [_The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy), and I enjoy _Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_ too.

Adam's writing style is hard to describe, but he's able to build otherwise mundane sentences in a style that makes me chuckle and appreciate the craft of writing. _Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul_ is a fun read, not as funny as _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ series, nor as thrilling as other novels I read over the last years, but it's fun nevertheless. This book is a good _buy and finish on vacation_ buy for lightweight reading.
