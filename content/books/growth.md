Growth is a book by Vaclav Smil that examines the ways in which human societies have grown and developed over time,
from micro-organisms to modern societies. The book is a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the various factors
that have contributed to human growth, including technological innovation, economic development, and population growth.
Growth provides deep insight into the patterns of growth that can be found in anything that we observe and where these
patterns break.

Throughout the book, Smil uses a wide range of historical and contemporary examples to illustrate the complex and
interrelated processes that have driven human growth. He also examines the various challenges and obstacles that have
hindered growth, such as resource constraints, environmental degradation, and social inequality.

Despite the book's length and technical nature, it is written in an engaging and accessible style that makes it a
fascinating and informative read. Still, I did not finish the entire book and hope to come back to it one day.
