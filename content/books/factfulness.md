## Notes

- **Gap Instinct**
  - tendency to divide things into two distinct and often conflicting groups with an imagined gap between them
  - liberals vs. republicans, us vs. them, etc.
  - beware when gap is mentioned and keep in mind that majority usually lies in the middle
  - don't compare averages, consider the spread as well
  - beware when extremes are being compared
- **Negativity Instinct**
  - tendency to notice the bad more than the good
  - distinguish better and bad, think can be bad but getting better
  - good news == no news, good news are often not being reported
  - gradual improvement == no news, gradual improvement is often not reported
- **Straight Line Instinct**
  - tendency to assume that a line will just continue straight and ignoring that such lines are rare in reality.
  - also expanded in the book [Growth]({{< ref "/books/growth" >}}) by Vaclav Smil, growth curves usually follow the _S_ shape
- **Fear Instinct**
  - tendency to pay more attention to frightening things
  - that's why people prefer news about mass shootings, murders, and other misfortune while ignore positive development
  - risk = danger * exposure
- **Size Instinct**
  - tendency to get things out of proportion, or misjudge the size of things
  - e.g. irrational feat of immigrants while the actual numbers are low, ties into the _Feat Instinct_
  - always search for the context of the numbers, single numbers on their own are often misleading
  - amounts and rates often tell very different stories
- **Generalization Instinct**
  - tendency to mistakenly group together things, people, or countries that are actually very different
  - look for differencies within groups, look for similarities across groups
  - majority can mean anything from 51% to 99%
  - vivis images are easy to recall but they might be exception, no the rule
- **Destiny Instinct**
  - idea that innate characteristics determine the destinies of people, countries, religions, or cultures
  - tendency to think that things are as they are because of inescapable reasons
  - keep track of gradual improvements, update your knowledge
  - if you need a reminder of how things were, talk to your grandpa
- **Single Perspective**
  - tendency to focus on a single cause or perspective when it comes to understanding the world
  - e.g. forming our worldview by relying on the media or our social bubble
  - test your ideas, limit assumption of your experise and be humble
  - _Hammer and nails_ - if you are good with a tool, you might be prone to overuse it, not one tool is good for everything
  - beware of simple ideas and simple solutions, world is never simple
- **Blame Instinct**
  - tendency to find a clear, simple reason for why something bad has happened
  - look for causes, not villains
  - look for systems, not heroes
- **Urgency Instinct**
  - tendency to take immediate action in the face of perceived imminent danger, and in doing so, amplifying our other instincts
  - used often in marketing
  - take a breath and time, don't rush your decisions, evaluate
  - insist on the data
  - beware of predictions, future is uncertain ("_this stock can't go tits up_"[^tits_up])
