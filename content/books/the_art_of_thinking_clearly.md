title: The Art of Thinking Clearly
---

_The Art of Thinking Clearly_ is a book that provides practical tips for improving one's thinking and decision-making.
The book covers a wide range of topics related to cognitive biases, logical
fallacies, and other common pitfalls of human reasoning. In many ways it overlaps
or references [Thinking, Fast and Slow]({{< ref "/books/thinking_fast_and_slow" >}}) by Daniel Kahneman.

Throughout the book, Dobelli uses real-world examples to illustrate the various cognitive biases and logical fallacies
that can affect our thinking, and provides practical advice on how to avoid these pitfalls. He also discusses the
importance of critical thinking and the need to question our assumptions, as well as the benefits of adopting a more
logical and analytical approach to decision-making.

The Art of Thinking Clearly is a highly accessible and engaging book that offers valuable insights into the
human mind and how it can be improved. It is a useful resource for anyone looking to improve their critical thinking
skills and avoid common mistakes in reasoning.
