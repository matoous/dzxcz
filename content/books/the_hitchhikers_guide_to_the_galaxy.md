title: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

I am pretty late to the party with this book but as the saying goes; _Better late, than never_.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a delightful book, brilliant in both its witty humour and
unique style. Fiction was a welcomed break from all the demanding books I read lately,
and I have a strong feeling I will include more fiction books into my reading queue.

> Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen.

As a side note, my plans of scrutinizing this book thoroughly bit by bit went out of the window
after a few pages, and I devoured it in less than a day.
