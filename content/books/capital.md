## Key Takeaways

**Inequality grows if rate of return on capital is greater than the economic
growth.** That is, when the average returns on capital (such as dividends,
interest, rates, and profit) are higher than the economic growth (growth of society's
income/output) people with more capital tend to cumulate more wealth, increasing
their income even more. This in turn accelerates the growth of the gap between
wealthy and poor.
