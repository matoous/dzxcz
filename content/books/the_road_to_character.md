## Notes

Two opposing sides of our natures:

- Adam 1
  - career-oriented, ambitious side of our nature
  - wants to have high status and win victories
- Adam 2
  - wants to embody mora qualities
  - a quiet but solid sense of right and wrong, not only to do good, but be good
  - wants to have cohesive inner sould

### Takeaways

Roughly rephrased takeways from the last chapter of the book:

1. _We don't live for happiness, we live for holiness_
  - we seek to live live of purpose, righteousness, and virtue, not just for pleasure
  - best life is oriented around excellence of the soul, moral joy, gratitued, and tranquillity
2. The above proposition defines the goal of live
  - road to character begins by understanding our nature
  - the core being that we are _flawed_ - tendenecy toward selfishness and overconfidence
3. _In the struggle against your own weakness, humility is the greatest virtue_
  - humility is having accurate assesment of our nature and place in the world
4. _Pride is the central vice_
  - pride blinds us to our weaknesses, makes us more certain and closed-minded, makes us more coldhearted, and deludes us into thinking we are authors of our own lifes
  - because of pride we try to prove that we are better than those around us
5. _Once the necessities for survival are satisfied, the struggle against sin and for virtue is the central drama of live_
  - winning is not possible, the goal is to get better at waging the moral war
  - there are heroes and schmucks in all parts of world
6. _Character is built in the course of your inner confrontation_
  - one does become more disciplined, considerate, and loving through a thousand small acts of self-control, sharing, and friendship
  - character is about engraving certain tendencies into our mind
7. The things that lead us astray are short term - lust, feat, vanity, gluttony
8. The things the compose character are long term - courage, honesty, humility
9. _No person can achieve self-mastery on their own_
10. _Defeating wekness often means quieting the self_
  - the struggle against wekness requires reticence and modesty, muting our own ego
11. _Wisdom emerges out of a collection of intellectual virtues_
  - knowing how to behave when perfect knowledge is lacking, which is almost always
12. _No good life is possible unless it is organized around a vocation_
  - vocation is not found by looking within but by asking what life is asking of us
13. Maturity is achieved by being better than you used to be, it is not comparative
