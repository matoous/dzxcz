Not really a guide to _Doing Nothing_ or _Resisting the Attention Economy_ as a matter of fact
but interesting book nevertheless.

_How to Do Nothing_ is well written and thoughtfull about philosophical and seemingly abstract concepts
of _the self_, attention, bioregionalism, and community. More than a guide the book poses as an essay
on what we are missing when social media grasps our attention, and whether our idea of "usefulness"
is the right one. Should we really consider time and attention to be a commodity we can exchange for
salary? And are we expressing ourselves honestly when we are limited by 280 characters and want to please
each and every follower?

There is really no summary to this book as it flows from one concept to another with sometimes
hard-to-grasp diversions to art, birds and nature. Would I recommend the book? I don't know.
It wasn't my cup of tea yet I somehow unintentionally finished the book and learned to like it
on the way.
