Tara was raised in a strict Mormon family, with bipolar father,
sociopathic brother, and mother that turned her back on anything that
was happening under her nose. Despite the odds and starting school
at 17 Tara received doctorate form history at Cambridge.

_Educated_ is wonderful book full of events that seem to be too
insane to be true. Heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.
Memoir of how far can one get despite the odds and how much our
family and childhood narrates our life.
