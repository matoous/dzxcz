_Death's End_ is the last chapter in the [Remembrance of Earth's Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) trilogy by Cixin Liu. I read the first book [The Three-Body Problem](({{< ref "/books/the_three-body_problem" >}})) back in 2021. Returned to the series in 2023 with [The Dark Forest](({{< ref "/books/the_dark_forest" >}})) and finally decided to read the last book in series after the Netflix adaptation came out.

I was putting _Death's End_ aside for a long time. The book sat at my office table since I bought it alongside _The Dark Forest_ which I still find the most chilling book I have read to this date. _The Three-Body Problem_ was in my opinion the weakest one in the trilogy (to be clear here, the book is still a great read, just comparatively weaker to the next 2 in the serieas). _The Dark Forest_ picked up the pace severaly and was a captivative and thrilling read causing the kind of experience as the border scene from the first [Sicario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicario_(2015_film)) movie.

Parts of _Death's End_ I have spoiled for myself reading more about the trilogy on the internet. Yet, it still enticed me in such a way I finished to book in 2 days. _Death's End_ brings the story to even grander scale picking up where _The Dark Forest_ left. As with the previous books, it is a captivative read evoking unease from beginning till the end. Now it's time to wait for how will the [Netflix adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(TV_series)) wrestle with the enormous scale of the book.
