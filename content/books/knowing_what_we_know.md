Simon Winchester's _Knowing What We Know_ takes you through history of _knowledge_ from ancient clay tablets through the adoption of GPS to inception of Wikipedia. It's a thorough examination of how we acquire, pass, and retain knowledge and how has this changed through human history.

I expected deeper scientific examination of cognitive paths related to knowledge processing and retention but _Knowing What We Know_ is rather a historic account and collection of stories and topics on knowledge. It's a fun read and examination of some of the greatest minds of our history such as [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) or [Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan) but unfortunately falls flat on tying all of its content together.
