- Writing is strongest when it's simple and clear of clutter.
- Make every sentence do useful work.
- Always be yourself. Warmth and humanity are the two most important qualities of good nonfiction writing.
- Leave the reader with **one** provocative thought that they didnâ€™t have before.
- Understated humor is the nonfiction writer's secret weapon.
