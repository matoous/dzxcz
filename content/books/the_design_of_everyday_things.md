## Notes

_Human-centered design_ - The process that ensures that the designs match the needs and capabilities of the people for whom they are intended
_Affordances_ - relationship between a physical object and a person. E.g. a chair affords support, therefore, affords sitting. A flat plate on a doors affords pushing while a know affords turning, pushing, and pulling. Affordance is jointly determined by the object and the agent that is interacting with it. To be effective, affordance have to be discoverable. Affordance determines **what** is possible.
_Signifiers_ - Signals presence of affordance. Signifiers communicate **where** an action afforded by _affordance_ should take place. E.g. a "Push" sign on a door.
