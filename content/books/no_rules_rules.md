## Notes

* Some points are too capitalistic even to my liking.
* For most companies many of the learnings are out of reach, for example paying top of the market and hiring mostly rock star employees.
* Candor is the most important part that can be applied even if you can't pay top of the market.
* Removing controls (in decision making and expenses) leads to innovative and faster-moving organization.

### Giving feedback

* **Aim to Assist**: feedback must be given with positive intent
* **Actionable**: feedback must be actionable and focus on what the recipient can do differently
* **Appreciate**: when receiving negative feedback avoid the natural instinct to be protective and show appreciation instead
* **Accept or Discard**: the decision to react is entirely up to the recipient

### Step one

* Built talent density
  * Talented people make one another more effective.
  * Averagely performing people can drag the performance of high performing team members down.
  * Inversely, performance is contagious.
* Increase candor
  * Say what you really think with positive intent.
  * Teach all employess to give and receive feedback well.
  * Build feedback into your regular meetings.
* Begin removing controls
  * Remove vacation policy, but the leaders have to set example by taking time off themselves.
    * The boss should provide a context for the team of when and how to take the vacation.
  * Remove travel and expense approvals, but ensure that employees follow _spend company money as if it were your own_.
    * The finance department should audit portion of receipts annually>
    * Speak about abusing the system openly so others understand the ramifications of behaving irresponsibly.
    * Some expenses might increase but not nearly as much as the gains from the freedom that they provide.
    * Fewer resources waster on administrative cost.

### Step two

* Fortify talent density
  * Divide workforce into creative and operational employees, pay creative employees top of the market salary.
  * Don't pay performance based bonuses, put the resources into salary instead.
    Measures for performance based bonuses are often wrong and don't reflect long-term incentives of the company.
* Pump up candor
  * Instigate culture of transparency, get rid of closed offices.
  * Open up the books to your employees and share sensitive financial and strategic information with everyone.
  * When doing layoffs or other decisions that will impact epmloyess' well-being be up front to build trust (might cause anxiety and distraction).
  * As long as you've already shown yourself to be competent speaking about mistakes will increase trust, goodwill, and innovation.
* Remove more controls
  * _Don't seek to please your boss. Seek to do what is best for the company._
  * In fast and innovative company, ownership of critical decisions should be dispersed across the workforce at all levels.
  * Teach employees to take risks but if they fail, to sunshine it openly

### Step three

* Max up talent density
  * _The Keeper Test_
    > If a person on your team were to quit tomorrow, would yo utry to change their mind?
    > Or would you accept their resignation, perhaps with a little relief?
    > If the latter, you should give them a severance package now, and look for a star, someone you would fight to keep.
  * Skip PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), rather take all the money and give it to the employee in a form of severance payment.
  * Encourage employees to use the _Keeper Test Prompt_ with their managers.
  * When employee is let go, speak openly about what happened.
* Max up candor
  * Don't link 360 feedback to raises or promotions and avoid anonymity.
  * Open comments to anyone who is ready to give them.
  * _Start, Stop, Continue_ method with 25 percent positive, 75 percent developmental - all actionable and no fluff.
* Eliminate most control
  * Lead with context, no control. Your goal needs to be innovation (not error prevention) and you need to be operating in a loosely coupled system.
  * Don't tell people what to do, get in lockstep alignment by providing and debating all the context that will allow them to make good decisions.
  * When something doesn't work out, ask yourself what context you failed to set.
  * Loosly coupled organization should be a tree, not a pyramid. The boss is the root, holding up trunks - senior managers who support the outer branches where decisions are made.
  * If team is moving in the desired direction using the information they've received from you and others around you know that you're succesfully leading with context.
