The Dark Forest is the second book in the [Remembrance of Earth's Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past) series by [Liu Cixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin). The book is the origin of the [Dark forest hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis), one of the possible solutions to the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox).

_The Dark Forest_ builds on the first book - [_The Three-Body Problem_]({{< ref "/books/the_three-body_problem" >}}) but in a grand scale spanning a time-frame of 300 years between the events at the end of _The Three-Body Problem_ and the first contact with Trisolaran fleet. As in the first book, _The Dark Forest_ is heavily based in science touching on other topics such as sociology and politics.

_The Dark Forest_ is a nail-bitting read, thrilling from beginning to the end and one of the fiction books that made it on my _Devaured under 3 days_ books list.
