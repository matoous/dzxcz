_The Elements of Style_, a century old at this point, is a handy reference of basic literary and grammar principles for writers. It's references as the main inspiration for William Zinsser's [On Writing Well](({{< ref "/books/on_writing_well" >}})) and  the most popular text assigned in syllabuses.

One the internet, the opinions vary, between a the book being a must-read and it being outdated and containing inaccurate grammar advices. Nevertheless, it's a short read, and even if inaccurate it server well as a reminder of writing principles of the uttermost importance.

## Notes

The Elements of Style is better kept at hand as a readers manual. Thus, the notes here are brief and reduced to what I found important in particular. Core principle, obvious but often neglected, is: be clear, concise, put your self in the background, and rely on basic construct unless you are certain of what you are doing.

### Elementary rules

- Use [serial commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma)
	> also referred to as the series comma, Oxford comma, or Harvard comma
- Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause
- Join independent clauses grammatically completing each other with a semicolon
- Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary

### Composition

- Paragraph is the unit of composition. Paragraph may be of any length as long as it holds together.
- Use active voice, unless making a particular word of a sentence the subject calls for a passive voice.
- Put statements in a positive form ("He was not keen of flavored coffee" should be replaced by "He disliked flavored coffee").
- Use definitive, specific, concrete language
- Omit needles words
- Keep related words together
- The place for the most prominent a word or group of words is usually at the end of a sentence, the second best option is at the beginning.

### Form

- Use exclamations sparingly, reserve them for true exclamations and commands.
- Do not spell out numerals unless they are part of a dialogue
- Use italics with capitalized initials for titles of literary work

### Style

- Work from a suitable design
- Write with nouns and verbs
- Revise, rewrite, do not overwrite. Diligently strike out words that do not add value to your writing.
- Avoid qualifiers such as rather, very, little, pretty
- Be clear - avoid fancy words, do not explain too much, do not construct awkward adverbs (tangledly -> in tangles), use orthodox spelling, and avoid shortcuts such as abbreviations unless readily understood

## Glossary

Exhaustive glossary is at the end of the book. Following terms are relevant to the notes above.

- _Appositive_ - a grammatical construction in which two elements, normally noun phrases, are placed side by side so one element identifies the other in a different way.
	> My sister, Alice Smith, likes jelly beans.
- _Participle_ - a verb form used either as an _adjective_ to modify _nouns_ ("the _hidden_ treasure") or to connect with auxiliary verbs to create different tenses ("we are _hiding_ the treasure").
- _Participial phrase_ - a modifier that uses the _participle_ to describe a _noun_ ("Walking down the street, he saw kids playing with a ball").
- _Preposition_ - a function word that combines with a noun phrase to form a phrase ("at the dawn", "by noon")
