## Notes

The Elements of Style is better kept at hand as a readers manual. Thus, the notes here are brief and reduced to what I personally found important.

### Elementary rules

- Use [serial commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma)
	> also referred to as the series comma, Oxford comma, or Harvard comma
- Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause
- Join independent clauses grammatically completing each other with a semicolon
- Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption and to announce a long appositive or summary

### Composition

- Paragraph is the unit of composition
- Use active voice
- Put statements in a positive form ("He was not keen of flavored coffee" should be replaced by "He disliked flavored coffee").
- Use definitive, specific, concrete language
- Omit needles words
- Keep related words together
- The place for the most prominent a word or group of words is usually at the end of a sentence, the second best option is at the beginning.

### Form

## Glossary

- _Appositive_ - a grammatical construction in which two elements, normally noun phrases, are placed side by side so one element identifies the other in a different way.
	> My sister, Alice Smith, likes jelly beans.
- _Participle_ - a verb form used either as an _adjective_ to modify _nouns_ ("the _hidden_ treasure") or to connect with auxiliary verbs to create different tenses ("we are _hiding_ the treasure").
- _Participial phrase_ - a modifier that uses the _participle_ to describe a _noun_ ("Walking down the street, he saw kids playing with a ball").
- _Preposition_ - a function word that combines with a noun phrase to form a phrase ("at the dawn", "by noon")
