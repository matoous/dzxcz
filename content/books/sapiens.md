Modern society is shaped by [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism) and
[consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism). Expensive fashion, travel and social
media dictate our lives without us betting an eye. How have we got to this point though?
And more importantly, _why_ have we got to this point? These questions and many more are
answered in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind.

In _Sapiens_ Harari divides the history of human kind into three distinctive important eras.
Our history began with the _Cognitive Revolution_ (70,000 BCE).
[Cognitive revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity) happened
when we developed imagination. Imagination allowed us to dominate the world through the ability
to believe in imaginary things such as gods, money, nations, laws, and more.
All large-scale cooperative human systems found their foundation in the cognitive capacity for fiction.
Be it trade networks, religions or political systems. All these systems are purely abstract
yet enabled us to cooperate on unprecedented scale, thus overpowering all other living species.
For example money, the powerhouse of economies and trade, is a system of mutual trust.
[Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) have their value simply because we (collectively)
believe in their value. The time when value of money was backend by the actual precious metals
is long gone, and even then what allowed money to exist is that we trusted that we will be able to
exchange money for goods because others have the same believes and will be willing to
accept money as a form of a payment.

With the money we are getting ahead of ourselves though. It was only in
3000 BC in Mesopotamia when the first commodity money - shekel - was introduced.
The first result of the abstract thinking was the ability to build larger groups.
The large scale human cooperation in the form of archaic tribes, medieval kingdoms or
modern states is rooted in common myths, existing purely in our collective imagination.
None of these things exist outside the stories that people invent and tell each other.

The second era began with the _Agricultural Revolution_ in 10,000 BCE when first Sapiens
settled and learned to co-evolve species like cows and wheat. With
[agricultural revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution) also came large
population growth. Large plains that were once able to feed single wondering
tribe were now thanks to agriculture able to feed many times more. The key claim regarding
the agricultural revolution though is that it made the lives of most individuals and animals
alike worse. Daily lives became less varied, our diet shrunk to a few crops and meat of
domesticated animals, and the permanent settlements brought diseases and other problems that
we were able to avoid thus far. All of this also required us to work more and harder.
Why did the agricultural revolution happen even at this cost? Frankly, we are not sure.
What we know is, that it wasn't possible to go back to our hunter-gatherer style of live once
the revolution began.

The _Scientific Revolution_ began the last era.
[Scientific revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution) was founded on change
in European though, whereby elites first time in the history became willing to admit ignorance
and try to remedy. With our newly gained power of saying "we don't know" and "we were wrong" we
started to discover more of the world and making first scientific breakthroughs.
Seeing the advancements that we are able to achieve gained science more trust which in turn
brought more money, which in turn brought more scientific advancements that allowed us
to enrich ourselves. This started the self-stimulating cycle of _power_, _resources_, and _research_.
More research brings more power, more power means more resources, and the more resources
are available the more we can invest back into research.

The idea of progress also funded the [modern economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system).
Whoever believes in progress believes that our technological inventions and organisational development
can increase the total sum of human wealth, production and trade. Progress broke our belief that
economy is [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) where gains of one are losses of others.
Once this dogma has been broken and people started to believe in better future new doors opened.
People agreed to represent imaginary goods - things that don't yet exist - with what is called
[_credit_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit). Credit enabled us to build the present at the expense of future.
All this is funded on the assumption that our future resources are more abundant than our present resources.
Baker could come to a bank to borrow money to open new bakery. Bank would be willing to lend the money believing
that the baker will be able to generate income in foreseeable future to pay his dept. All of this was
and is possible only thanks to our collective believe in better future and growth of overall wealth.

Many more ideas and phenomenas are presented in the book, too many of them to list them all.
I hope that the previous paragraphs are enough to give you an overall idea of what to except. 
Overall, _Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_ is a fantastic book that puts so many things
that we take for granted into their true perspective. The book also made me realize that the
history ain't all sunshine and rainbows. Mistakes were and still are made. Because of our greed
many species are extinct or live miserable lives to end up on our plates. And are we even happier
and better of than we were 70,000 years ago? In the essence of scientific revolution it is ok
to say that we don't know. Let's just hope that we are building better future not only for us
but also for other species.
