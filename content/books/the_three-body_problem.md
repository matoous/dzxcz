The Three-Body Problem hit the right spot for me and placed itself on the list
of _finished in a day or so_ books. I attribute that mostly to the book being more
on the **Sci** side than the **Fi** (whatever that means).
The scientific concepts in the book were mostly familiar to me and played nicely
together. Some of the character arcs seemed a little bit far fetched and flat
but the scientific side of the book balanced that out.

The book gradually builds up the pace over first 100 pages and than turns
into one thrilling rollercoaster with interesting plot-twists that keep you
on the edge of the seat gasping for yet another page. _Cixin Liu_ was able
to combine _Chinese Cultural Revolution_[^1], _The Three-Body Problem_[^2],
_Particle Physics_[^3], _Newton's laws of motion_[^4], _von Neumann Architecture_[^5],
and plenty other topics into one brilliant masterpiece this book is.

I am looking forward reading the next two books in the series and will unreservedly
recommend _The Three-Body Problem_ to anyone looking for conceptual, intelligent,
fictional book.
